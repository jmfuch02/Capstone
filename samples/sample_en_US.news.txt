I'd hazard to say that most of the dudes behind the "Brokeback" mashups haven't seen the film. No matter; having parodied it, they'll want to check it out. And I have a dream, see. I dream that somewhere out in Bushland people who missed "Brokeback Mountain" in theaters, either through their own fear or their neighborhood Cineplex's refusal to show it, will feel safe ordering it from Netflix and watching it in the privacy of their shag-carpeted living rooms, sandwiched between "American Pie II" and that sanctimonious exercise in sadomasochism, "The Passion of the Christ."

It is important to remember that efforts to maximize judicial "independence" from the electorate can also maximize independence from the law and the Constitution.

The national debt has grown significantly in recent years and it keeps rising at this very moment. The way that people get into debt is from spending and I believe that the U.S. has been spending too much. I am not very involved with politics or with the government, but from what I have seen, the U.S. is spending a great deal of money on useless things. I think it is time for major spending cuts. They need to start using their spending money to repay all the countries they have borrowed from in the past. If the spending does not stop, then the U.S. will continue to go further in to debt. With out all the useless spending, the U.S. can save some of that money to pay off the debt that has grown significantly. They can start to pay it off slowly, but a little at a time is better than nothing. I am just a high school student so I understand that my knowledge of economics is basic. However, this is the only solution that makes sense to me.

European paper wasps are often mistaken for wasps or yellowjackets, but are actually beneficial predators of caterpillars and other insects. Both take up residence in yards, so use traps for yellowjackets (they don't work for paper wasps or hornets). Eliminate favorite nesting sites like hollowed-out areas. Insecticides are effective on active nests, but apply at night or early morning. More at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/ insect/05525.html

The Mistake: I got an opportunity to form a partnership and buy Sawmill Creek Resort several years after I worked as a general contractor on the condominiums at the property.

For instance, on June 29, Cincinnati's 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back a challenge, originating in Michigan, to the Patient Protection law's coverage requirement. A three-judge panel ruled that the mandate falls within the Commerce Clause of the Constitution; issues might be raised by how the new law is applied, but on paper, the judges saw no constitutional bar. The final word on that, of course, will come from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Like the beautiful October afternoon in 1989, when the San Francisco Giants were playing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. And then, out of nowhere, came an earthquake. It caused the Cypress Structure of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to pancake and caused a big fire in San Francisco's Marina district. Brick buildings collapsed in San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. The earthquake lasted only 15 seconds, but it killed 63 people and put the fear of God into millions.

This means that if you want to bake a pie, but don't have a good pie crust, I've got that covered for you. In baking, it's the foundation pieces that matter most.

Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

The crew's guide-training on the ridge two years ago planted a seed.
With 3.1 seconds left in the game and the Hawks trailing 81-79, Boston’s Marquis Daniels was called for fouling Hawks center Al Horford as teammate Marvin Williams was about to inbound the ball.

• Center fielder Curtis Granderson made perhaps the catch of the season, running down Justin Morneau’s drive to the alley in left center during the Yankees’ 7-3 loss to the Twins Monday night.
One breakdown by Collinsworth I didn’t like was when he questioned S Kenny Phillips on Robinson’s 34-yard touchdown in the third quarter. It was against a Cover-2 look and Phillips had two receivers coming at him. One was WR Miles Austin in the slot, who wasn’t rerouted by Rolle. Phillips had to honor Austin, which is why he was late to get to Robinson. I wouldn’t blame him there. If I had to point to where the coverage could improve, I’d say Rolle could’ve influenced Austin a bit more and CB Corey Webster could’ve sunk deeper and more quickly because there was no threat in the flat. However, it’s also a great throw and catch as well.

But you and I know this is a reality show first and foremost and the only thing that keeps "The Voice" from joining the ranks of such long running reality shows like "Survivor," "The Apprentice" or "The Bachelor" is the absence of a Nasty Elimination Round Catch Phrase like "You're fired!" "Please pack your knives and go," "Your tour ends here," "The tribe has spoken," "Ding Dong, the door's for you." "Give me your jacket and leave" or "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. You're dead to us." All right, I don't even know where that last one came from, but the fact that there's a directory of these phrases tells me that "The Voice" should have one too.

The first half of the solution is to be grateful for what we have. We differ greatly among ourselves in our level of affluence. But almost everyone in the U.S. has access to clean drinking water and flush toilets. Almost everyone will find a Thanksgiving dinner -- whether at home, with friends and family, or in a shelter. And everyone can find medical care in an emergency. This is not enough. But it is a set of blessings not available to half the people in the world. We must count our blessings.

Then I add in the Golden Globes (knowing they’re a joke, but realizing all the Hollywood hype they create) and the awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (because the industry is so full of, and intimidated by, British talent).

Mr. Rodricks also notes the Social Security contributions and taxes illegal aliens pay and subsequently don't collect.

New York duo Eric Ronick and Than Luu have booked time touring with Panic at the Disco and Rachael Yamagata. Appropriately enough, their new project confidently strums out frisky indie rock with quirky touches of theater, fun and Radiohead (or at least Coldplay before it stunk). It's not going to blow you away. But there's a dearth of cool new music out these days, so this is worth a listen. As the album shines on, the boys indulge poppier urges, stealing beams of light from Rilo Kiley. Grade: B

Congratulations to Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan on his retirement ("Dolan steadied city's police force," editorial, April 28). As a business operator in north Minneapolis, I've had the opportunity to see Dolan strategically transform one of the toughest areas of the city into a much safer place to conduct commerce. He used solid, fair police practices and collaborated with business, religious and community leaders. Enjoy your retirement, chief. You deserve it.
The cream sauce was another matter. We used fat-free half-and-half as our base, but you also could substitute fat-free evaporated milk. Thickened up to a creamy consistency, without the use of half a stick of butter, we were off to a good start.

The OHSU scientists plan to inject the stem cells into as many as six children, ages 2 to 12, suffering from one of two forms of Batten disease. These genetic diseases, which hit perhaps three of every 100,000 U.S. children, are caused by low levels of enzymes that break down granules of fat and protein. Without the enzyme, the granules build up in the brain and cause ever more damage until death.

Turns out, the U.S. Attorney's Office says, it was Tran. The boat's owner didn't want to pour any more money into the fake fishing voyage than absolutely necessary. So rather than top off the fuel tanks to make it look like a round trip was planned, he bought just enough gas for a short, one-way trip. And no matter how hard they tried, Tran’s henchmen could not sink that boat — buoyed by that fuel tank, an unsinkable balloon of air.
But the devil is in the details. More must be done to ensure local police departments' compliance, to track and deliver the kits in a timely manner and to approach, in a sensitive and professional way, those survivors whose kits have been sitting on shelves for years.
One reason for this is the fact that Cleveland plays in the AFC North, which sent three teams to the playoffs last season. So that's six games against teams with a combined record of 33-15 (.688).

Chilling the wine can also help hide flaws. Hammond says white, blush and sparkling wines should be stored on ice. The red can be kept on the back porch, depending on climate, so it is slightly chilled.
When potential voters turn directly to the Internet for information, there is an even more intense search for self-satisfying bias. Fully 33 percent of those who went online to get political news last year sought information from sites that "share my point of view," the Pew study shows. That's up from 26 percent in 2004. The biggest change came among the young, with the share of those 18 to 24 saying they got political news from online sites that reflected their viewpoint jumping to 43 percent in 2008, up from 22 percent in 2004.

Of course, it's precisely in these desperate moments that things become most fascinating, because we have no choice but to set our preconceptions aside. "I'm interested," Weschler says, "in what it's like when people or places suddenly catch fire." This can be an aesthetic process or it can be political, or, as in the case of "Vermeer in Bosnia," it can be both. It's also a pretty good description of Weschler's own approach to writing, which is, by turns, literary and journalistic, an idiosyncratic mix of the reported and the inferred.

Myers notes there's still not a lot of evidence of cord-cutting, or people canceling subscriptions and just watching for free. "Yes, people want to watch content in all these places.

Deathly quiet: Resting in peace is the operative concept at Rome's so-called non-Catholic cemetery edging the Aventine Hill, where Testaccio meets the Ostiense district. Look for the giant marble Pyramid of Cestius, find Via Nicola Zabaglia, and enter the hallowed gates.
Carl Meacham, a top staffer of the Republican minority at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the conference that the Obama administration's handling of the Rousseff visit reflects the fact that -- despite Brazil's status as the world's sixth-largest economy and its recent discovery of massive oil reserves -- "Brazil is not viewed as a first- or second-tier issue for U.S. foreign policy within the White House."
Willoughby Hills didn't give itself enough credit after smoothing out White Road. Crews left a pair of orange "BUMP" advisories alongside fresh pavement on White just east of Bishop Road in Lake County, reports column correspondent Arline Debelak Price.

"According to new information brought to my attention, some witnesses now suggest that the versions of events attributed to them in CPD reports from 2004 were not accurate, including one witness who now claims that his observations during one of the lineups conducted were not accurately memorialized in police reports," Alvarez wrote. "To be clear, at this point, I have no objective evidence to support the notion that there was any misfeasance or malfeasance on the part of investigators in this case. However, with this new information, it is my belief that an independent investigation from a separate police agency is clearly warranted to ensure that we reach the truth in this case."
Uriel is a difficult man in his own way — he likes telling students that their work has things in it that are new and correct, "only the new things are not correct and the correct things are not new" — but, in conversations with both his wife, Dikla (Alma Zak), and his long-suffering mother, Yehudit (Alisa Rosen), it's clear that he cares more about the father-son relationship than the older man does.

There's not much in the bare-bones decor and ambience of Kurata to distract you from the food. The folks serving the handful of tables and the four seats at the sushi bar are businesslike and efficient, occasionally too efficient. It's not unknown for everything you order to show up pretty much at once, producing a jam-up that could have you looking around for more table space -- which in a place this small and popular won't often be available.
His rejuvenation has rubbed off on his bandmates. It wasn’t long ago that guitarist Nils Lofgren had both hips replaced; at the Izod Center, he took a long, wild, imaginative solo during "Because the Night" while gyrating and hopping in circles on one leg. Drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent gave the impression that they could play another two and a half hours without dropping a stitch. Charlie Giordano, the accordionist and organist who is filling Federici’s chair, had a particularly strong night, adding vivid color to "The E Street Shuffle" and a soul medley that included the Smokey Robinson-written "The Way You Do the Things You Do" and the Wilson Pickett hit "634-5789."
The numbers told part of that story. In the first 21/2 months of 2008, Donnelly and Achilli exchanged 632 phone calls, a little less than nine a day. Over the same period, she exchanged 425 calls with Garcia. But it veered toward the one-sided: Garcia called her 271 times. She called him 154 times.
The cake layers are all-natural, not a speck of chemically treated flour in the batter. The buttercream has all real butter, and the fresh rose topper is organic and fragrant, a dazzler that comes in many colors. All of this is what you expect from a natural foods purveyor, with polished elegance as a plus. We loved the moist cake but would have liked a spike of lemon in our raspberry filling and a frosting recipe without a slick mouth feel at the finish. But you try it; there are plenty of options, including whipped cream, chocolate mousse and cream cheese.
More relevant to the crisis, borrowing costs for European nations stabilized. They had risen alarmingly in recent weeks - in Greece, then in Italy and Spain, then across the continent, including in Germany, the strongest economy in Europe.

The business is driving the basketball. Not the other way around. And there's a tremendous ongoing power play among the personalities below Allen. I suspect it's why Portland has had such a revolving door of a front office, and why hiring the next general manager has become a high-wire act for the Blazers.
Despite the Cardinals falling from serious contention by mid-September, FSM had its best-rated year in the 15 seasons the Redbirds have had a widely available cable/satellite TV package, surpassing the pervious mark of 9.2 that was set in 2005.

He started NeXT Computing, which made computers for higher education and corporations. Technologists took to the computers — including British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, who used them to create the World Wide Web in the early 1990s.

City Hall’s real estate sweepstakes: Downtown developers are looking for tenants, any tenants, to fill a new office project. The city, it just so happens, may be in the market for new office space. The Bureau of Planning & Sustainability and the Bureau of Development Services live in the city’s 1900 S.W. Fourth Ave. building, a short walk south of City Hall. Portland State University would like to take over the building. So, the two bureaus may at some point need a home. Leonard has been in talks with developer Brad Malsin about potentially moving the BDS to a project at the east end of the Burnside Bridge. The Bureau of Environmental Services, now in the Portland Building next door to City Hall, may be in the market, too. Developers Jim Winkler and Bob Naito have been trying for years to break ground on a PDC-backed project called One Waterfront Place just north of the Broadway Bridge. The word around the building is that Winkler is trying to recruit BES to help anchor his building. All of this and more will be on the table at a council work session at 2 p.m. Thursday. Office space planning has always been a challenge for the city given that each bureau answers to a different elected leader and they typically don’t coordinate their moves well. The work session is an attempt, for now at least, to improve that coordination.
Aldridge hit 9 of 10 shots, and led the Blazers with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Gerald Wallace, in his second start with the Blazers, was a bundle of energy, finishing with 17 points, six rebounds, six assists, two blocked shots and two steals. And Wesley Matthews hit four three-pointers and joined Batum with 14 points.

"Look at this, look at all the damage," said Jennifer Burckson, 49, after she came outside Sunday morning in South Windsor to find a massive tree branch had smashed her car's back windshield.

Canada's consumption of methylphenidate — drugs such as Ritalin — puts it among the top-three consumers of the drug, according to the 2009 Annual Report of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board. The Great White North trailed only Iceland and, yes, the United States.
"So far, we have seen no evidence to support the implication that NHTSA has allowed politics to guide its decision making," said the subcommittee's top Democrat, Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland. "I am concerned that an effect of this hearing could be to undermine technology that's critical to both protecting the environment, and ensuring the success of the U.S. auto manufacturing industry, as well as to generally have an adverse effect on U.S. economic competitiveness."
Drew is still young, so she faces a number of important variables that could significantly impact her retirement plan. Purchasing a home with reasonable related expenses will not derail her retirement dream, Pirrello says.
Sitting in that boat off the coast of California, I thought our travel luck had finally changed - until the cell phone rang and my sister-in-law, known for interrupting romantic moments, called my wife just to ask what she was doing Thursday night. By the time my wife got off the phone, she was feeling seasick, and we were heading back to shore.

A challenging CUP process, big parking issues and maybe upset local citizenry would surely await. But the money to be made, as shown by the Royal Hawaiian's claimed "after hours" monthly lost profit of $25,000 alone is not inconsiderable.
The Question: I read with interest your article on the new way of depositing checks from your home or office using either a cell phone picture or scanned image. I have a few reservations. What is to prevent someone from depositing the check to two different bank accounts at different banks? I know many people who have checking or savings accounts at different banks. Would the check be charged twice to the drawer's account, or would one of them be returned?

By now, you are probably wondering: where is the Big Boi album? Well, it's here, sad to say. It never clicked for me, and I'm not entirely sure why. I always love Big Boi's rhyming, and some of the individual tracks are fantastic, but I find the second half of the record a real chore. I admit that I could never get into the tracks with Janelle Monae and Jamie Foxx, and they're back to back, and right after that there's the George Clinton song that I don't understand. I zone out around there and only re-engage when "Shine Blockas" comes on, and that type of thing never happened with an OutKast set. I adore them to pieces, and I will happily pay money for anything they put out, but I'm convinced now -- Andre and Antawn really do need each other.

A senior catcher, Duran proved to be a tough out in victories over Escondido, Vista and San Pasqual. Not only did Duran go 6-for-11, she sent three pitches where no one could catch them - over the fence - in a span of four at-bats, collecting six RBI and powering the Titans to the triumphs.

Still, some narrative threads about Rothko's motivations can be teased out.
Hankins, bristling at the attack, says he is more conservative than Messer. Hankins sees it as a last-minute move to redefine him with voters.
Annie is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie Glenn. Americans rightly "ooh" and "ahh" over John Glenn's courage in space, but let us never forget the hero of a wife who gave her public blessing, and then privately prayed until his safe return.

Instead, when asked why he had done something that appeared to be in plain violation of the state law banning government resources from being used for political advocacy, Ekard denounced the question as "dangerous" and "silly." How arrogant and imperious can you get? The county's top bureaucrat disdaining the very idea that clearly written state law would apply to him!

Kansas player who must be locked down: Kansas point guard Tyshawn Thomas was playing on a right knee that required surgery soon after the Jayhawks' win over Ohio State on Dec. 10, when he had nine points, 13 assists and seven turnovers. He's looking to be that much better today. "I think a lot of people forget that I was hurt when we played the first time," Taylor said. "I was playing with a big brace on my knee, which is really uncomfortable. I wasn't 100 percent. From Dec. 10 till now, I think I'm a completely different player."

But there was something the jury -- and the public -- was never told: This was the third set of accusations that Guevara had molested students. Twice before, when law enforcement officials had decided they lacked the evidence to win a criminal conviction, L.A. Unified officials had quietly put him back in the classroom.
A problem with both K2 and bath salts is that while the chemicals have been made illegal in Michigan, the fact these "lab drugs" are someone's chemistry project allows them to change the chemical make up and skirt the law after testing is done by our MSP crime labs. The Michigan House and Senate both have bills that would give the State Department of Community Health the authority to temporarily categorize substances such as K2 and so-called "bath salts" as an imminent danger to the health and lives of Michigan residents as controlled substances. This would allow the new chemical make up, when identified, to be subject to Michigan drug enforcement laws.

"You know I was disappointed to lose. I want to win as much or more than anybody else, but after I had some time to reflect, I thought it was a really good season. If you had looked at it, and someone said to you at the start of September, 'Hey, what would constitute a successful season if you had three guys out for the season — one would be Greg, one would be Jeff Pendergraph, another would be Elliot — and you knew Brandon was going to miss 35 games, if you knew Joel was going to miss 26 games and then you knew Marcus was going to miss 23 games — what would constitute a successful season?' And I think if we said making the playoffs and going six games against a very good Dallas team who won 57 games, then I think you could say it was a successful season."
The manufacturing projections are not surprising, says Steve Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Manufacturing as a share of private-sector employment has been declining for decades, he said, because of outsourcing and, more importantly, "the rapid pace of labor-saving technological progress," which is affecting employment in the sector even in developing countries.

Babeu this week downplayed his interaction with students and his role in the school's management. In his e-mail statement, he said he is a recognized leader for victims rights.
Unfortunately, this may all change if we don't take action. The administration's proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year -- now in front of Congress -- includes a devastating 20 percent cut to planetary funding. A cut of that scale will eliminate several Mars missions, break international agreements that jointly support other missions, eliminate any large-scale "flagship" missions for the foreseeable future and force us to abandon any plans to explore the potential habitability of the "water moons" Europa and Enceladus, circling Jupiter and Saturn.

In a battle among Senate Republicans, Mayer won the nod to be the next president pro tem over the man who appeared to be in line for the job, last year's majority floor leader, Sen. Kevin Engler, R-Farmington. Among the things his colleagues criticized Engler for was his decision to limit floor time for certain conservative issues, including changing the Missouri Plan, because of opposition from moderates in his party and Democrats.
Perhaps one of the most interesting characters, though, is the man we learn the least about. The mysterious Mr. Li, who lives on an ocean-worthy yacht named Invictus, is a representative of The System and coordinates its divisions in the field, so to speak. Readers can only hope that Epperson has a sequel on deck and that Mr. Li returns. What thriller fan doesn't love a shadowy character at the heart of an international crime conspiracy?
But Obama's bill faces a troubled path in Congress, as Republicans strongly oppose its plans for tax increases on the wealthy and other spending provisions.

Gosselin, who has called TLC a "monster" and blamed the network for destroying his marriage, is an "exclusive" employee, which means he can't accept payment from other sources to talk about his situation.

Yes, yes, after seeing the pilot, the network wanted to ramp up the action. We had a little bit, but they wanted more, which is kind of ironic because the original script had a very elaborate car chase and I thought, 'Oh, that will be fun,' but by the time we began shooting, it was gone, of course, for budget reasons. But now we have another action sequence in the pilot, which I think is actually better. I hope you liked it. It's the one in the gas station — it was fun.
By the time Johnnie reached the hospital on the evening of March 6, her condition was dire. Doctors told family members that surgery was the only recourse for a severe bowel obstruction but, in her weakened state, the risk of complications was high, court records show.

Many of the groups aiming at Obama are tax-exempt advocacy groups that do not disclose their donors and are running so-called issue ads, which do not explicitly call for a candidate's defeat or election. Independent fact-checkers have found many ads to be misleading or outright false. Nevertheless, they can be biting.
You order at the counter at this crazy-quilt colorful eatery blooming with bright landscape paintings, parrot sculptures, mural-topped communal tables and bouncy Mexican music, but that doesn't mean fast food. Even a simple taco can take 10 minutes for the cooks to assemble to-order, though it's worth the wait for this $1.50 feast of 10 filling choices including al pastor, chorizo or beef cheek.
They started 11-25 and Goryl was fired, replaced by his third base coach, Billy (Slick) Gardner. That was the season split into two parts, with the Twins finishing 17-39 and last in the first "half,'' and 24-29 and fourth in the second.

One last bit, this time on Portland: It appears that Portland's African American community could be moving away to some extent. Despite modest growth statewide, just 55 percent of Oregon's African American population live in Portland, that's down from 65 percent 10 years ago.
Orvieto has narrow alleyways and streets made out of volcanic tufa winding up to the 13th century duomo on the crag. With its glistening gold facade and Signorelli's visionary paintings of the "Day of Judgment," Orvieto's cathedral is one of Italy's most important Gothic specimens. Because the town also boasts 50 restaurants and 500 sommeliers for 21,000 inhabitants, the traveler's material as well as spiritual needs are well catered to.

It takes a while. Davies begins the film with words – Rachel Weisz’ Hester reading what sounds like a love letter. But it is, we soon realize, a suicide note. And with classical music throbbing, we watch as she takes pills, turns on the gas and then disappears into a pure reverie of images.

A strategy that focuses on how the force will exit fails to consider how military success will be translated into political success. And a focus on extricating ourselves from a conflict rather than on achieving success - also known as victory - signals to an adversary that if he ratchets up his resistance, we will exit more quickly.

Sunday's break in that pattern likely reflected a sense of anger and impotence among protesters upset that Putin was handily elected to a new term in the Kremlin despite their defiance.

But although Weinstein might be pressing the issue to benefit his company, that doesn't render the issue invalid. An R rating covers an overly broad range of cinematic territory, from an extra couple of four-letter words to racy simulations of sex acts and full frontal nudity as well as persistent and extreme violence. Yet for all of these, the attendance rules are the same.
Nicole Stacey, Recovery Resources’ social worker at Rocky River Middle School, urges parents to “start conversations with your children about the dangers of alcohol and other drugs as early as possible, along with your conversations about other safety issues.

INDIANAPOLIS — Al Kelly’s left arm is in a sling, and it’s driving him crazy, because it’s messing with his sense of order. And he needs things orderly. He can tolerate chaos on his desk — the organized chaos of a polished multi-tasker — but he has little patience for any aspect of life that won’t submit to his layout.
Niehaus did not respond to a request for comment. Seitz, the caucus member who broke party ranks to vote against SB 5, disagrees with the suggestion that the process was bipartisan.
Peacemaking is my profession. For more than a decade, I have been arranging meetings between South Ossetians and Georgians -- schoolchildren, mothers, teachers and even soldiers -- to discuss the values we shared and the misunderstandings and hatred that have driven us apart. Child by child, person by person, village by village, we worked to defuse the historic and complex tensions in South Ossetia, a region of diverse ethnicities and national identities.
Quenneville does deserve credit for coaching a team filled out with kids and aging veterans to 101 points.

The Fiesta Bowl would be fine not hosting a bowl in certain years, if it can host a playoff game. On the other hand, the Rose Bowl would prefer to just be the Rose Bowl, sticking with its traditional matchup of Big Ten champion vs. Pac-12 champion on New Year's Day. But those league champions will often be heading to the playoffs in a new format.

Even as his exit from Maryland in May 2010 seemed to signal the beginning of the end of his storied coaching career, Cottle and lacrosse could never divorce themselves. So as he prepares for the start of another training camp Friday, this time as the head coach of the Chesapeake Bayhawks, it’s both a surprise and not one at all he’ll soon be blowing a whistle leading his own team once more.

The Great Thumb Fire: A decade later, this blaze broke out in early September 1881 in a heavily logged area of the Thumb that had suffered through several months of drought. The flames burned more than a million acres in Sanilac, Lapeer, Tuscola and Huron counties, killed 282 people and caused an estimated $2.3 million in damage (more than $53 million in 2012 dollars). It was the first disaster to which Clara Barton's newly formed American Red Cross responded.

O'Fallon may not have the offensive firepower it's had in recent seasons, but the Panthers remain atop the conference standings.
With all of the horses seemingly healthy -- and you know how quickly that can change -- the focus here will be on the style of the race. Trinniberg, as I wrote in my story on the draw, is the wild card. Having never raced more than seven furlongs, his connections nevertheless feel convinced that their horse will win the race. Does such wild-eyed confidence mean they're prepared to let him dash from the gates and see how far he'll go? Top trainers such as Bob Baffert and Graham Motion deferred when asked yesterday how they thought the race might unfurl, saying that it would be up to the jockeys.

Speaking of showing up, lots of Ducks fans at Staples Center on Sunday. Plenty of Blazers fans, too. Felt like a neutral-site game at times. Maybe they'd all been sucked in by the 3-0 start. Maybe they were just looking for something to do on the eve of the Rose Bowl. No doubt, what anyone who saw the game was served was a reminder that one furious quarter almost never erases three panicked ones.
Here are a few ways to make a bouquet garni.
Since Ford launched the first version of the Fusion in 2006, the car has been a hit for the automaker, selling more than 200,000 vehicles for several years.

The Colorado Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of two 527 groups — the Senate Majority Fund and the Colorado Leadership Fund — that had paid for ads supporting Republicans in the 2008 election.

At anytime we have 200 job orders with companies open. They are real jobs. We've vetted them, so we know that they are not sort of looking for applicants or that they are just posting jobs to post them. "It has gone up.

Clark said it was time for a "come-to-Jesus meeting where we can sit down at a workshop and hear about compensation for employees, what is mandated by some kind of legislation and what is discretionary."
Caterer Chad Harris' menu is simple, but the ingredients all have a pedigree. The chicken in the Nashville Hot Chicken is from Fulton Valley; the crispy battered wing, thigh and drumstick are piled on a sturdy slice of bread, which helps to soak up the copious amount of grease. The bread and butter pickles skewered on top make a nice contrast to the fried food, as does the macaroni and cheese, which strings like a harp when you fork into each bite.

These perceptual perks have real-world benefits. The scientists argue, for instance, that the ability to process vast amounts of data helps to explain the prevalence of savant-like talents among autistic subjects. Some savants perform difficult mathematical calculations in their head, others draw exquisitely detailed pictures at a young age. These skills have long remained a mystery, but they appear to be rooted in a distinct cognitive style shared by all autistics. Because they can process details that elude the rest of us, they can perform tasks that seem impossible, at least for the normal mind.

Eva Restaurant: Genial chef-owner Mark Gold is ready to feed the hungry with omelets with roasted shiitake and heirloom tomatoes but quickly gets into heartier stuff — prime steak with eggs, roasted potatoes and salsa verde, or even a grass-fed prime burger with all the fixings. Er, that would be more for a late brunch, no? A bit lighter: eggs, bacon and avocado sandwich on pain de mie. To drink: The bar makes an heirloom tomato spicy Mary. Or if you really sleep in and can't make brunch, consider Sunday family dinner, which starts at 4 p.m.
Police Chief George Gascón shut down the drug analysis section of the crime lab last month after a technician was suspected of stealing and using drug evidence. That prompted Harris to drop hundreds of pending criminal cases, and her office has been scrambling to check the integrity of other cases.

I've been testing Calltrunk, a service that records, stores and transcribes calls initiated by its app or website; a manual feature on iPhones and Skype also enables recording incoming calls. It uses landlines, mobile phones or Skype accounts to place calls, and these calls are stored in a password-protected account for $5 to $50 monthly. I also tested Uppidy, a free service that, once installed on an Android phone or BlackBerry, automatically logs all text messages sent to or from that phone in a Web-based account for reading or sorting later.
"We've just started talking about it with the kids this week after really noticing them over the last couple of days," said DiScenna, whose classes are often outdoors to make scientific observations of nature.

At least 82 children between the ages of 6 and 19 are known to have died while playing the choking game, according to the CDC, although the true toll is probably higher because there’s no reliable system for counting such deaths.

"It wasn't about seniority," Mourdock said. "It was about coming in with some new ideas and some new energy. And I think that's a very important part of this campaign."
Sales of previously owned homes fell in March for a second month, dropping 2.6 percent to a 4.48 million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors reported last week. Purchases of existing homes are calculated when a deal closes about a month or two after a contract is signed.

As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say so before the convention.

Critics say hospitals are underreporting and that puts patients in harm's way. As long ago as 1996, a government agency concluded that the number of hospital reports was "unreasonably low."

Our budget situation is not a Beaverton problem; it is an Oregon problem. Districts throughout the state have been faced with similar budget challenges. Beaverton has reduced budgets by $105 million, largely sparing schools from deep cuts. We have used the ending fund balance and other one-time savings, negotiated employee concessions, reduced infrastructure and central office personnel, and minimally reduced the workforce through staff attrition to balance the budget. Many of these past options are no longer available.

It's a job that, so far this year, has included an investigation into a student's brutal off-campus beating. There was the boy who brought a pocketful of prescription pills to sell  even though they were non-narcotic drugs aimed at managing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There was the call from a substitute teacher who reported a dice game in progress  on a science lab table. And there was a wall full of gang graffiti in a bathroom, which could have been the work of a real gang or maybe just some wannabes.

Berkman said he felt some bite in the calf since returning to the lineup Tuesday night against Cincinnati. On Wednesday, he extended his hitting streak to seven games to start this season with an infield single in the first inning. He raced to beat the play at first, and then he was involved in a double steal before finally sprinting around third to score on David Freese's double. Berkman said he knew there was still soreness in the leg in all that running, but it wasn't until the top of the fifth inning when soreness became injury.

It's been more than a decade. The city has already spent $13 million. The property does not generate revenue of any kind: the mounted patrol pays no rent on the warehouse they use as a headquarters and horse barn. Portland doesn't have the money for a new park.

Lacking a support system doesn't mean he'd be a franchise quarterback with one. Improved? You'd certainly hope so. But it's not as if -- "presto" -- he goes from Eric Zeier to Drew Brees. If it were that simple, a lot more teams would be targeting undersized, third-rounders as the answer.

For Romney, a Michigan defeat would be disastrous. Romney was born in Detroit and raised in Bloomfield Hills, an upscale suburb. In 2008, he won the Michigan primary by a comfortable nine-point margin over McCain.

Our debate about whether to get another slice was cut short by the arrival of warm, doughy bread and small salads, which came with the dinner pastas we ordered. The salads, a crunchy mix of lettuce, tomato, cucumber and banana peppers dressed in an herbaceous house vinaigrette, were fresh and — thanks to the peppers— a little spicy.
If we are lucky, my grandmother will make her rice cakes, small pillows of rice that resemble fat noodles, sautéed in a dark soy sauce with bits of celery, green onion and more lap cheong.
“Clearly, we're seeing some moderation in the economy,” Culp said. “We all read the headlines. It certainly is prudent at any time in the (business) cycle. But I think our view is, particularly so right now given the uncertainties around 2012, better to be prepared and ready for what may come than to postpone what we think is a very prudent action here.”
The president, who constantly rails against Ecuador's "oligarchs" and has already moved to diminish the power of banks, accused the lawmakers who voted against the measure of "defending the bankers, not the depositors."

But Mod Lang is hardly an ordinary record store. For instance, the top sellers in the store last week were the pop peripheralists New Pornographers, the Lovemakers and BMRC, artists who would be found considerably further down such lists at Virgin Megastore and Borders. At Mod Lang, there are only two Beatles titles in stock, although more than 30 by British folk-rockers Fairport Convention. "You can get Beatles CDs at petrol stations," said Paul Bradshaw, who maintains his British locutions after more than 25 years in this country.

And say to myself, 'Next time you're faced with that situation, approach it in a different way.' When it's all said and done, man can't judge. Only God can judge."
Environmental artist Andy Goldsworthy caught that complex sensibility adroitly in "Faultline," his site-specific work at the new M.H. de Young Memorial Museum that sends a spidery crack through the sidewalk and eight boulders in the entry courtyard of the sleek contemporary structure.

Hallman said mayors must use their offices as "bully pulpits to inform our electorate, when making decisions on who should be governor, when making decisions on who should be legislators, you've got to understand that it's more complicated than some bumper sticker. Because that bumper-sticker stuff is killing us."
One challenge is how to enforce those principles. The White House wants to put them into law, and that's a good idea — provided that lawmakers resist the urge to require or ban specific technolgies. Until then, the administration plans to work with industry groups and other interested parties on an optional code of conduct that will be legally enforceable. Why any Web company's legal advisers would allow it to agree to such a code is a mystery, especially if there's no guarantee that its competitors or disruptive new entrants will.
The editor prize was a shock when Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" beat out the editors of "The Artist." Only three times in the last decade has the film that won the editing honor lost the best picture contest; "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" was not even among the nine best picture nominees.

Next week, on May 17, the Palace of Auburn Hills will stage an unusual State of the Pistons event, hosted by former Pistons player and TV chatter man John Salley.

"For the amount of money that was spent, it should have been well-thought," said Olivia Stanley, parent of a second-grader.

Injection well: Wells in certain geological formations that can safely contain waste water from the oil and gas wells. That includes the water used in hydraulic fracturing, as well as brine that naturally comes from many Ohio wells.
Previous reports have suggested that amnesty would be handled as a "stretch exception" -- one that would let teams waive a player, but stretch his salary cap hit over double the length of the remainder of the deal, plus one year. So if a player is owed $12 million over two seasons, he could be waived, and although he would still have to be paid, his cap hit could be stretched to five years at $2.4 million each year.
øYou may think that one way around this is not giving a potential employer permission to contact a former employer.
Peters averaged 11.8 points and 9.3 rebounds for the NCAA runners-up as a senior. Making those statistics more impressive is that she played only 24.2 minutes per game -- the least of any Notre Dame starter. That's largely because she was the team leader in fouls, with 102, but only fouled out three times.
More coverage: The Internet buzzed after Kate Middleton and the fictional Bella Swan (in the "Twilight" movie) wore wedding gowns with long sleeves. Would strapless gowns topple from their perch? Not exactly. "You put a sleeve in the gown and to get a beautiful fit you need a tight armhole, and that really eliminates movement," Durham said. "I've seen brides spin their arms around like a propeller when they're dancing. Sleeves hinder that." Kate's example is being felt, however. Cap sleeves are gaining popularity, as are illusion necklines, as in a strapless dress with a sheer overlay that rises to a boat neck. Longer veils are back, too. More than three in every four women in a David's Bridal survey conducted last fall planned to wear a veil. Many brides are wearing their hair partially down with a veil, as did Middleton, for a modern twist.

"I think I've gotten maybe a little freer playing the piece. When I first learned it when I was about 21, I played it much more from the standpoint of a classical pianist. One of the things I've realized is, ‘Rhapsody in Blue' - unlike the traditional one cadenza that so many concertos have - has a whole bunch of them. There are several extended segments where the piano plays solo, and that allows you a certain degree of freedom."

"We were hoping to inspire Americans to commit to taking one 'combat shower' a week, until all the troops come home, so for those 3 minutes in the shower, they can connect to and share in the sacrifice of our armed forces," Hale wrote. "I've heard many soldiers say that things are very different from WWII, where the war seemed to affect every family. ... I've not seen any kind of 'poor me' attitude ... I think in part because this is an all volunteer Army ... but I do get the sense that soldiers feel like most Americans have no idea of the burden that our armed forces and their families have carried this past decade."
It’s not a myth. Prisoners really do make license plates in New Jersey.
"I guess it's better than what it was," Shoaf said. "That being said, it's still a lot of money."
She explained she and fellow organizer Allison Stangle decided to organize the camp to fill a need. Mann said there are plenty of camps for younger girls, but once they reach high school age, it's harder to find a place to learn without being scouted by private companies.
The cottages have free, high-speed Wi-Fi Internet access, but other than that communication with the outside world was a little tricky.

The issue has been a favorite of Obama's in recent weeks as he appeals to student voters who flocked disproportionately to him in his 2008 presidential campaign. He turned to it again Tuesday during a visit to the State University of New York in Albany, where he tried raising pressure on lawmakers to act.
"And there was nothing wrong with that, was there? With a guy like him buying a kid like her a nice lunch, spoiling her a little? It was good for her. It was just a little tonic for his poisonous heart. Right? Why shouldn't he have that? It was good for them both. And so it was good for everybody -- because that's how goodness works."
"This means a lot to them," Bryant said. "Remington has been such a great example to all the football players on our team. He works out harder than anybody. It sure did pay off to the other guys."

The solution: Nick Sekscenski, a certified personal trainer at the Merritt Athletic Club on Fort Avenue in Locust Point, says supplementing your workout with strength training is a necessary addition to any fitness plan. "The more muscle you have on your body, the more calories you're going to burn while resting," he says. Lifting weights might not burn as many calories as jogging a few miles, but it will increase your metabolism for a longer stretch of time, he says. Sekscenski points out that building muscle does not require bulking up — simply lifting light weights and adding lean muscle mass will do the trick.
Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde called the budget "a good old-fashioned tax-and-spending plan" and added, "sadly, but not unexpectedly, proposals for radical economic reform were largely notable by their absence."

The Blazers' scenarios: New Orleans' loss to Utah means the 6 seed belongs to the Blazers (47-33) if they can take care of business at home against Memphis. That would give Portland a two-game lead over both the Hornets (46-35) and Grizzlies (46-34) with one game to play. A loss to the Grizzlies would put Memphis in control, although the Blazers can finish no worse than seventh if they win either of their final two games. Portland wraps up the season Wednesday night against a Golden State team will be without Monta Ellis, and possibly Stephen Curry too. The scenarios:
"It is incredibly important that we find the causes," Emken said.

"We do not say there should be a de facto moratorium waiting for that," Ulmer said. "Instead, we talk about the importance of doing the research with a specific timeline and focusing the research on decisions that need to be made, both by the private sector and the public sector."
The proposal is pretty simple: Levy a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes in California and spend most of the proceeds on medical research. Voters might base their decisions on the matter on questions as simple as whether they oppose any new taxes, or whether they're glad to see a revenue producer that, by raising the price of cigarettes, is sure to lower smoking rates.

One good measure of valuation is the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio: the value of the company divided by its earnings, or how much money it makes after it pays for its costs. P/E is a good measure of valuation because P/E tells you how much investors expect the company to grow in the future. (This is because what an asset is worth is, in theory at least, the "net present value of its future cash flows", or how much you're paying now for the money it's going to make in the future. So the higher the P/E ratio, the more money you expect the company to make in the future.)

Little Bits escalated from wearing his underwear backward to wanting to wear all clothing backward. Now, wearing underwear backward isn't that big of a deal (except that he is always picking his ill-fitting under garments out his rear) but when he wants to wear his pants or shirt the wrong way round, we start to have problems.

Second, when you dress up that way, people give your parents very strange looks and your parents have to spend a lot of time explaining things to random nosy people at the store. Things like, 'No, I am not punishing my child with public humiliation' and 'Because he wants it that way!' and that gets old. And thirdly, haven't you noticed that it's hard to go to the potty when you wear you pants like that?"

The CBO reckons the decade's savings at about $264 billion. How about slowly moving Medicare's eligibility age from 65 to 67. The savings: $125 billion.

I suppose it makes sense. After all, Catholic nuns are so rarely embroiled in sex scandals. They are never caught pants down in the rectory with a 10-year-old altar boy, teaching him of the "mystical secretions" of the Lord. They never cost the church billions in litigious payouts for rape, abuse, millennia of pedophilic atrocity and shame. For that, you gotta look to the priests.

Not that there are many mystery writers who don't owe Christie something. The genre was popular long before she took a stab at it with "The Mysterious Affair at Styles" (which sat in the publisher's office for five years before it was accepted for a pittance and published in the early 1920s), but it was much more hidebound. Hercule Poirot entered loudly dismissing all the old familiar tropes, proudly declaring that it was not for him, this Holmesian propensity for scrambling around in the dirt collecting cigarette ash and bits of burnt letter; instead the work was done by the little gray cells. Tommy and Tuppence Beresford were the postwar adventurers, creating a whole new template for romance with their thrill-seeking banter, and the popularity of Miss Marple began the race for Most Unlikely Detective, in this case, a spinster of a certain age who used her hard-won understanding of human nature to solve crimes.

Last week, however, the diocese burst the bubbles of those elated parishioners by announcing the Vatican actually had upheld 12 appeals, not 13 as widely reported, and St. Margaret Mary was the unlucky 13th parish.

Supporters of Proposition 29 say that voters want to see a strong relationship between a special tax and how it's spent. Cigarettes cause cancer, heart disease and lung problems, so it makes sense to use the tax to find out more about those diseases. To paraphrase "Thre Mikado," whose "object all sublime" was to "let the punishment fit the crime," the idea is that the object must be to let the benefit fit the tax.

Why it's hot: The weekly "Pulp the Party" helped spark a renaissance for subculture dance nights in Ybor City and beyond. No need to peacock here, folks; just let your freak flag fly. "It's about blowing off steam and not having to pop your collars or putting on a jacket," said mastermind Paul Geller, a.k.a. DJ Pauly Crush, of Orlando. "We take pride in delivering music that isn't being played at other clubs yet, or maybe ever will — certainly not on the radio." That means maintaining a core group of like-minded DJs with similar musical tastes; Geller even grooms new up-and-coming DJs to fill in. Pulp also brings quality drink specials, like a free keg of Stella Artois, $1 and $2 vodka drinks and free vodka shots when a snow machine goes off twice an hour. For Pulp's third anniversary party in July, they offered free drinks from 9 p.m. to midnight, and there was a line around the block to get in.

Making every effort to secure an interview with Orton after she appeared at SXSW in Austin, Texas, and was touring her way toward California, I managed to make only momentary telephone contact during her stopover in Salt Lake City. Before she begged off for tea and breakfast, Orton did acknowledge that she'd grown weary of the compulsive perfectionism engendered by studio-centric recording. (Attempts to follow up were thwarted first by the demands of sound check and then by noise outside and inside the Mexican restaurant Orton was ducking into for a bite before the gig.)

Interestingly, we haven't heard much attack on Mr. Zimmerman's right to own or carry a gun under Florida law. What is at issue (aside from the potential racism involved in the death of an unarmed 17-year-old African-American in a hoodie and the initial failure of authorities to fully investigate or file charges in the incident) is whether state law should be set up in such a way as to encourage an individual to seek confrontation in a shoot-first, ask questions later manner.
That's the next thing. We will never sell or have an IPO. What that does is suddenly flushes you with cash. It makes you now work for a group of stockholders, who, again, put pressure and temptations on your true-blueness. They're people who have said, "You need to turn this into a franchise." And I don't want any of that. The fourth one is we don't want employees. We only want autonomous collaborators that are incentivized to make or break their own income. To be the Frank Perdue of pastured poultry: That never interested me. I want thousands of us scattered all over the country.

They like to talk, but not about themselves. Vera Katz can go on for hours about school funding or campaign finance reform, as anyone who served with her on the City Council in the 1990s or in the state Legislature knows all too well. Mel Katz is not shy about expressing his opinion on art and culture and the petty rules and regulations that stifle the human spirit. What they don't like -- what Vera Katz particularly doesn't like -- is to talk about a difficult childhood that included an escape out of Nazi-occupied France during World War II or a struggle with a rare form of cancer that almost killed in her last year as mayor. A story of wartime courage and triumph, and a story about a medical miracle, that another politician might repeat endlessly is unknown to almost everyone who knows her name.

Andrew has that ability to erase everything else from his mind and focus on his race."

The goal came with 1:03 to play in the second period, just after Dwight King had gotten 2 minutes for slamming Alex Pietrangelo into the boards. Off a face-off in the Kings' end, Brown took the puck and raced up ice, with Kevin Shattenkirk in pursuit. Brown held him off long enough to get off a shot that Elliott blocked, but Elliott slid into his net after making the save. Brown and Shattenkirk went behind the boards and the next person to get to the puck was Greene, who chipped it in before Elliott could recover.

A: It has always been a goal of mine to be a head coach and have an opportunity to develop a team and we're there now. We're developing this team. Obviously, we have a ways to go but when I arrived here in Cleveland, we weren't that good either. But you can see changes were made and things were done the right way. Mike Brown came in and Danny Ferry made the right moves, and LeBron and his guys fell right into it. Those are the types of things we have to do with this team. I just want to be a part of that building and development process and see it come to fruition in the end.

Gingrich thrived for a while in January. His candor won him supporters in the seemingly endless string of Republican debates. But his ex-wife Marianne said Gingrich had offered her a choice of an open marriage or a divorce, and at a debate two days before South Carolina's Jan. 21 primary, CNN's John King asked Gingrich about the report. The question, the candidate snarled, was "as close to despicable as anything I can imagine." The audience applauded loudly, and Gingrich won the state's primary.

When I was starting out, I did get the usual critiquing, told to change this or do that, but you know, finally you have to say, “This is who I am.” People are always going to try to change you, but I think you have to stick to your roots and say, “This is me.” And not get caught up in that whole, oh, you have to lose 10 pounds.

Caitlin's inspiration for making dreams happen for hospice patients came from volunteering since seventh grade for Hospice Care of the West and a scene from the movie "Patch Adams."

Auctioneer Keith McLane resembled Fred Astaire as he worked the ballroom at a charity event one recent Saturday night. Suited up in a tux, he moved lightly from table to table, and motioned with long, tapered fingers. He took care never to point directly at a bidder  too in-your-face, he said  instead gesturing solicitously, palms up, as if merely presenting possibilities.

The strategy didn't work even if many of Bryant's field goals came on deep jumpers. But they were good looks for Bryant because, well, he's Kobe, and he created enough space off efficient jabs and pump fakes. One time, Bryant stepped back with a Dirk Nowitzki-like one-legged fade-away. On another play, Bryant pump-faked, drew a foul on Arron Afflalo and sank a 16-footer that bounced off the rim and dropped through the net. Bryant also attacked aggressively in the post.

Estevez accomplishes this by embracing the repetitive, ritualized essence of the pilgrimage itself. As lush landscapes and picturesque villages pass by on the screen, scene after scene after scene, the metaphor of life as a journey and a struggle begins to sink past the level of intellect. It's obvious, but it's still true, and when Tom and his motley compatriots reach the end of the road and each delivers a pithy summation, their exhausted satisfaction is contagious.
Gomez appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday to make a statement, against the wishes of his attorneys.

The Auxiliary of Slovenian Workmen's Home, 15335 Waterloo Road, in Cleveland, has been holding a fish fry 49 Fridays of the year for over 30 years. They started holding the fish fry in the public bar on the first floor of the building. The dinners were cooked in the lower level, and the waitresses would run up and down the stairs placing and delivering their orders and never out of breath. What a workout they got. . . . Most of the members of the auxiliary are now over the age of 80 (15 of the 20 members). One of the waitresses is now 90 years old, and a 98-year-old is the silverware wrapper. . . . These volunteers are truly dedicated in preserving the Slovenian heritage at the Slovenian Workmen's Home.-- Pat Nevar, Euclid

Lessons Learned: There’s a reason reporters used to keep a bottle handy.
City officials and the visitor's bureau have been trying for decades to create an entertainment area to bring tax dollars and a sense of identity to the city. The closest they came was in the 1990s when a developer planned a Universal Studios-type project next to Great America, though it never came to fruition. They also courted the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants for new ballparks, to no avail. But the city thinks it's finally reeled in its superstar.
The purveyor for the whole chicken ($40) wasn't listed on the source sheet, but I was told it was Fulton Valley, the same bird you can get at Zuni and LuLu for less money. Nevertheless, it's one of the best values -- and one of the best-tasting dishes -- on the menu.

 Some of the defendants did say things that perhaps they shouldnt have said .. but they had a right to say it, Weiss told the Free Press today, saying its unfortunate that people are getting indicted for speaking their minds. Its the thought police.

Berkman required less than 30 minutes after entering camp last February to make those around him feel comfortable. However, the longtime Houston Astro needed to reaffirm to himself that he retained the production that has made him a six-time All-Star. Knee surgery sabotaged his 2010 season, leaving him to sign a one-year, $8 million deal that many within baseball thought a lapse of judgment by the Cardinals.
I don't remember who we played but it was late summer of 2007. I got free box seats from a customer at work and ended up going with a buddy who had started going to matches earlier in the season. If you've never sat in the boxes before - don't waste your time. We sat in the box for the first half but felt very isolated. The Timbers, if I remember correctly, had a significant lead at the half and the Timbers Army was hopping. We moved down close at halftime, probably section 109 or so.
Whenever this issue comes up, all sides grab at the past and start waving the parts that flatter them. That's an endless sinkhole, one I try to avoid by asking, "What next?"
In the final minutes, Zagrans suggested discarding the charter.
"I always think something is going to happen," Brian said.
The crony capitalist deals with the Solyndras of the world are at an end. The massive health care bills that nobody can now figure out how to pay for are yesterday. The president can't keep fighting with this all or nothing attitude. It makes him look like Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, an aging starlet who still thinks she commands the crowds she once did.
The wild card in the process was Bo Xilai, the Communist Party chief in the city of Chongqing, whose firing March 15 has unraveled the party's carefully spun narrative.

"His neighbors just behind have a pool in the back yard, and the family found three-inch long darts all over the pool deck, in the pool and on their roof, and they called the city a few years ago," Segal said.
"It doesn't matter," she says. "I don't think they have any advantage." The only concession to their blindness is that all matches start with competitors holding opponents' lapels. By remaining in contact, the blind fighter can erase any sight advantage. "I can actually feel what you are about to do, so you try to do something, I can reverse it," Danyelle explains.
Plans call for Paulino to throw a bullpen workout prior to today’s series finale against Detroit at Comerica Park. That will allow the club’s on-field staff a first-hand opportunity to gauge his recovery from a strained right forearm.

When asked if she was worried about perhaps letting too much of her private life show in a breakup album that quickly starts sounding personal, Jones waved off such concerns.

Apparently, the intersection of Altair Drive and Pitman-Downer Road (a Gloucester County road) has not experienced enough major accidents to have caused the county to make some changes.

If you're on vacation, it's probably not worth it. That's the advice Osterreicher gives NPPA members, too: It's not worth a trip to jail. "Be courteous, be respectful and don't get into an argument," he says. "Should you have the time and want to push the issue, ask to speak to a supervisor or report the incident to that agency as soon as possible. Otherwise, they have a badge and you may lose the argument."

In a December lease agreement, the county spells out minimum benchmarks for its private partner, requiring Chicago-based MMPI to host 43 exhibit hall events and 72 meetings or banquets in other parts of the facility. By its seventh year, the convention center must be 35 percent occupied, bring in 214,500 attendees (in- or out-of-town) and generate 33,000 hotel room stays. By MMPI's calculations, that could mean $708 million a year in total impact.
A few miles north, just outside Woombye, stands the Big Pineapple. Australia has a peculiar fondness for tourist attractions with the word "big" in the title: There are also the Big Banana and the Big Potato, neither of which we hit. The oversize pineapple is visible from a distance, and you can climb inside it if you want. We decided to take the train ride through the park's pineapple and macadamia-nut plantation.

Political leaders in Warsaw say they want to join the euro zone eventually.

In general, as the free throws illustrated, the Cavs didn't have much margin for error. The Nuggets outrebounded the Cavs, something that doesn't happen often, and it allowed Denver to get 18 second-chance points.

These Democratic critics dismiss Dream 2.0; without a sure road to citizenship, they say, it's worthless. But is that how an immigrant parent would see it? I wonder. Here's a bill that would allow your child to go to college, get a good job and have a legal future in America. No, it's not perfect. It would be awhile — maybe even many years — before she could vote. But in this case the perfect may be the enemy of the good. The alternative to Dream 2.0 isn't Dream 1.0. The original bill couldn't get through Congress in 2010, and it couldn't pass today. The choice today is Dream 2.0 or nothing.

"That’s what special services was into doing, when they were doing anything," he said. "You had employees (who) decided they just wouldn’t come for the summer.

Then there's this: Partisans will argue till the rapture about whether Kasich, when he ran for governor last year, did or didn't signal his plan to fetter public-employee unions.

Line judge Byron Boston marked the ball between the 19- and 20-yard lines — a yard and a half further than the furthest Pascoe’s forward progress took him. I’m not even positive he had the first down there. It didn’t matter because the Giants punted but Boston was right there and I can’t believe he botched that spot so badly.

The unit has since been totally remodeled, and my family has received a bill for $23,000 in damages.

I wouldn't even be here had Greg not gotten hurt."
Santorum, like any suddenly emerging challenger, is a blank canvas on which the Romney campaign will write. It has already made large ad purchases, which are not likely to feature positive Romney bio spots. But when it comes to negative attacks, the Romney campaign does not yet have Santorum's number. Santorum did vote for earmarks and a congressional pay raise. But these crimes against conservatism pale in comparison to Romney's own. Santorum supported debt-ceiling increases. But this distasteful legislative responsibility has also been performed by most of Romney's congressional allies. Santorum is no libertarian but neither is Romney. On the size and role of government, Romney has a serious log-in-his-own-eye problem.

Under those rules, Timbers Army members attending the game will ride to Seattle in 10 buses (one leaving from Tukwila, Wash.) that will stop at a designated stadium entrance. Two hours before kickoff, the fans will pass through security, allow workers to screen their signs for offensiveness and file into a designated section. Monitoring their behavior and that of the Sounders fans around them will be Qwest security, two Timbers front-office staff and eight security guards who work games regularly at Jeld-Wen Field.

When the Big East men's basketball schedule arrived in the Rutgers offices during this past offseason, it was carefully studied and dissected. There were the obvious thoughts about which games would be winnable and which ones would be difficult. But throughout the athletic department, eyes scanned down to today as one of those rare opportunities. Not for what might happen on the court, but what could be reaped off of it.
But Bereket-Ab told Shiffa he was likely to get a 15-year prison sentence if he came back to Will County, saying he "would rather live in poverty for 15 years than return to the U.S.," according to a law enforcement official involved in the manhunt. And with that, Bereket-Ab was free.

Aftab said parents should talk to their children about being involved in cyber-bullying, either as the victim or instigator, and take steps to address the matter. For instance, parents should be watchful to see if a child's behavior or attitude about social media and technology, such as text messaging, has changed, which could be an indication they have been harassed, she said.
The hardest one to handicap. All five women were wonderful. Cruz, who has picked up a few awards already for playing Javier Bardem's crazed ex, appears to be the favorite, but she's been much better in other films (the recent "Elegy" for example). Tomei, who won this award 17 years ago for "My Cousin Vinny," will get votes for screen bravery. She has been mostly naked in her last two films.

Banks would be subject to higher capital and liquidity standards. The government could intervene in cases where a bank had become a systemic risk to the economy. The bill would finally give the government some control, but not enough, over the risky derivative markets. It would give the government some, but not enough, oversight of the secretive dealings of hedge funds. And it would set up a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to monitor the consumer credit market.
Liang said that he and Panetta talked about ways to strengthen cybersecurity, but they are leaving the details to the experts.
On at least three different days, the student journalists said they found the alarms were producing decibel levels that were potentially harmful and too loud, according to National Fire Protection Agency standards. They compared the sound to new tornado sirens tested in St. Louis County at a 70-decibel blare with a range over a mile.
"I really try to preach grinding it out," he said. "Don't let it get to you. Forget that (bad) shot and go to the next shot. Obviously, I want to see the girls go for par on every hole. But once you take a shot away from having any chance of a par on a hole, figure out how you can get a bogey on a hole. Bogey is not a bad score, especially for girls golf."

Last month the city removed fencing from the Brock property using incorrect practices, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The removal damaged native habitat and the year-round stream that is a tributary for Wilson Creek. Instead of removing the fencing by hand, the city used large machinery that was driven over the stream and ripped out nesting habitats that should have not been touched until after June 15. The city also sprayed the herbicide Crossbow during this nesting season.

There's obviously an audience for the film, probably a large one. They are content, even eager, to sit in a theater and watch one action figure after another pound and blast each other to death.

It is to that level of the brain's reptilian complex that the film appeals.

With so many cuts made in previous years to the district's programs and faculty, Lyda says it's unfortunate the district didn't ask for money to cover the cost of bringing back some electives or hiring more teachers.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is less delicate. In a letter to Duncan, Rubio says the rule of law is at risk: “NCLB allows the secretary to grant waivers for existing provisions under the law, but nowhere does the law authorize waivers in exchange for the adoption of administration-preferred policies.”

Berlusconi has been replaced by Mario Monti, a brainy, bespectacled technocrat whose serious demeanor already has many Italians cheering because of the respect accorded him by other world leaders, including President Obama.
Dunham, 25, plays Hannah, the most compelling character of the quartet. A slightly pudgy aspiring writer, Hannah seesaws between her sense of entitlement and self-loathing, which explains her willingness to repeatedly hookup with a narcissistic tool like Adam (Adam Driver).

On Jan. 28, the Dania Beach Vintage Motorcycle Show will celebrate the love of motorcycles (without the crime and death) at an event now in its sixth year in the beachside town south of Fort Lauderdale. The weather in January is dandy for riding, with temperatures hopefully not venturing into the sticky, summery realm of the high 80s and 90s.
What has changed, but not as much as I'd have imagined, is the food. For the last few months, Jason Travi, who has worked at Spago, La Terza, Fraîche and is now corporate executive chef for Best's restaurant group, has been tweaking the menu at Firefly. Though most of the dishes are new, they're all in the same rustic Mediterranean mode established by former chef Gary Menes. If anything, they're more generic than Menes' graceful originals were. (Menes left to open Palate Food & Wine in Glendale and now is looking to open his own place.)

A: From early childhood, when my father hung a giant mural of a world map on my bedroom wall and gave me a shortwave radio, I have felt wanderlust. Traveling and meeting people in diverse places is a part of this urge, as is developing a more philosophical understanding of humanity and the world and myself. As I dance the stage in this ever-changing world, it is not as a tourist but as an entrepreneurial investor in the future of nations.

If Obama wins re-election, he will have Putin as a sometime partner and sometime adversary through the end of his presidency. If Republican Mitt Romney wins, the dynamic might be very different. Romney has called Russia an "enemy," while Putin has signaled that he will hold off on any major new cooperation with the United States until he knows who will be president.
Proximity also played a role for Wasowicz, who plans on majoring in public health. Her family and friends can watch her play at the West Village school anytime they want.

"It’s sad that size 14 is considered horrible," says Simpson, who receives fan mail as well as death threats. "It’s wrong to modify your body for men, but every woman in the world seems to do it. Women want to be super thin with big boobs. They get collagen injections and plastic surgery and rack their brains trying to lose 20 pounds. On the holidays, it’s time to eat, time to have fun, time to relax and then it’s like, ‘Gotta start the diet Jan. 1.’ It’s funny how people feel so guilty for eating."

BART's rail cars are unique and costly for a number of reasons, including their lightweight design, which requires aluminum shells instead of stainless steel; a power system using more voltage to provide faster acceleration; wider tracks, presumably to provide a smoother ride; and sturdier parts to handle BART's higher speeds and quicker acceleration.
"The vision is to create a fund that would be specifically tailored to foreign-born talent, entrepreneurs who want to start their business and get their idea off the ground," said A. Eddy Zai, chief executive officer of the Cleveland International Fund. "The goal is to get them to start their business here in Northeast Ohio."
I don't think fans need to hit the panic button by any means. If there are more departures it might raise a red flag, but Brown has a history of transferring (he went to three high schools in four years, leaving Findlay Prep in the middle of the season when he was a junior) and Barron wasn't playing much, so it's hard to get a read on him. The most interesting part of Altman's post game press conference last night was that he seemed very sad to me. For a no-nonsense guy like Altman, this was a little different demeanor.
"It did seem in some ways to not honor the commitment that people thought they had," said Stokes, who acknowledged friction between the local community and Hopkins.
Four of Steen-Andersen's pieces, which were meant to be performed without a break, boasted more formal shapeliness. The high point was "On and Off and to and Fro," a long and varied but still well-organized ensemble that involved clarinet, vibraphone and cello along with three electronic megaphones; a solo cadenza for siren sounds and feedback was just one tour de force among many.

The agency is currently looking for a private investor to expand I-75 and I-575 in Cobb and Cherokee counties.

It's strange to think that for nearly 11 full years, Seton Hall — a program that has gone to two NCAA Tournaments in the time frame — had gone unranked in the Associated Press poll. But coming into Tuesday night's game against DePaul, the Pirates had gone 332 games between their last game as a ranked team (a 70-64 loss at home to Rutgers). Even though the last AP Poll featuring Seton Hall appeared on Jan. 30, 2001, the Pirates played two games before falling out of the poll for good.

In more recent years, Skowron worked as a White Sox community ambassador.
Not exactly a country-folk album, "The Secret Sisters" is more like an Americana version of Maddy Prior and June Tabor’s Silly Sisters project: standards associated with male vocalists wryly reinterpreted by a pair of talented young women. They pinch "Somethin’ Stupid" from Sinatra, warm up George Jones’ "Why Baby Why," and turn their tart tongues on two Hank Williams chestnuts. This project was overseen by T Bone Burnett, which means the traditionalist bona fides are unimpeachable.

Such projects may be the group's great dilemma. State officials believe optional toll lanes are among the best tools to offer regional congestion relief, serving exactly the function the regional referendum was meant to provide. By charging a toll that rises with congestion, they keep out people who can't afford it, thus creating one thing that does not currently exist in metro Atlanta: the choice of a reliably congestion-free lane, spanning a long distance.

Milk-braised pork comes thinly sliced, moist and fork tender accompanied by leeks and gnocchi-like bites created from the saved milk whey. A sublime crepe stuffed with rabbit is a classy mash-up reminiscent of a pot-sticker, yet more refined.

Do you see any thematic connection between your work in documentaries and your work in fiction films? In all my films, I'm interested in larger-than-life characters. But in documentaries, I'm trying to take the chaos of real life and make it as compelling as fiction, while in fiction films, I'm trying to make a made-up story seem like reality. So in a way they are opposites and use different parts of my brain. It's like the difference between journalism and art.
"This show has never been slicked up," said Schaeffer. "You know how things are on Broadway: Everything has to be bigger and better. But what's always been at the heart ofrock 'n' roll, and the key to this piece, is the raw energy of these guys playing. It becomes infectious from their energy."

After having six anchors put in my shoulder and months of rehab, it came time for softball season again. I was not yet able to throw; I even tried to switch to throw left-handed, but it didn't work. So I was the designated hitter for the season and cheerleader while my team was on defense. Our team ended up winning districts and going on to take the state championship. I was able to end the season with a .340 batting average and have the game-winning RBI squeeze bunt in the state championship game."
But Apple didn't upgrade the front-facing camera; it's the same low-resolution one as before, which makes for grainy pictures and video calls. And it didn't add a flash to the new back camera, which means you won't be able to take decent pictures at night.

Jonathan Turley is probably not the most popular man right now with supporters of same-sex marriage. The George Washington University law professor has filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of Utah's anti-polygamy laws — and his argument is based on a landmark 2003 Supreme Court gay rights decision. That's not good news in the view of most gay rights supporters, who don't want their cause linked to that of polygamists any more than they want to see parallels drawn with people who engage in incest, bestiality and other taboo sexual practices.

Finally, Reservoir has the fourth best offense and third best defense in the league. This is their spot to lose.

Looking for a meatless entree, I could have ordered the broiled orange roughy ($14.95) with sauteed mixed vegetables. Not being a roughy fan, I picked the crab cakes marinara ($9.95). The two cakes are sauteed until brown and have a light texture and sweetness and little hint of fillers. They were heavily topped with that ubiquitous marinara sauce, which pretty much drowned out the flavor of the delicate crab. Again, a little less would have been better. A generous side of linguine with marinara goes with the crab cakes.
"The Westmoreland affair, professionally and personally, was one of the most difficult times of my life," Wallace told the Chicago Tribune in 1989. "It was just devastatingly difficult because my integrity was put to question, and as a reporter, that's the single most important thing you've got."

How will he follow this up? Smith doesn't have to be great. He doesn't have to set career-highs. But he must be a factor. He can't be a zero offensively. And by now, he should have the knowledge that he can contribute in a variety of ways if he's confident and into the game.
It was the second tough decision the Packers have made this week after releasing veteran left tackle Chad Clifton on Tuesday. But parting with Collins wasn't entirely unexpected. Packers coach Mike McCarthy expressed concerns at last month's NFL meetings.

øThe biggest complication that will affect many investors is that brokers aren't required to track the cost basis on investments bought many years ago. Also, if you moved from one brokerage firm to another, the firm you're leaving isn't required to forward the cost basis on the stocks to the new brokerage firm. Things can get tricky, too, if you're buying and selling the same investments in two separate brokerage accounts.
"Hairstylists and colorists, they're artists at their core, so they're always fooling around with things from the arts-and-crafts store," said Kristin Perrotta, Allure magazine's executive editor. "Somewhere along the line a few of them realized there were soft pastels you could use to leave color on your hair."
We lost "Lost," "24" and "Law & Order" at the end of last season. "Lost" producers, of course, long ago announced that they'd be calling it quits after six ABC seasons. And Fox's "24" had pretty much run its prime-time course. But NBC's "Law & Order" had some gas left in the story tank, and it certainly deserved the chance to break the "Gunsmoke" record for most seasons by a drama. It's just one example of how shows that the networks canceled were better than the fall newcomers replacing them.
Favorite subject: Band. "It gives me the opportunity to express myself through music. It's the one hour a day when I can relax and not worry about writing papers or studying for exams and be around people who share my interests."

I agree. But as I read Magill's article, I realized it was all about the physical; it didn't address some what is becoming, to me at least, an increasingly important benefit of being a lifelong runner: all the people I've met along the way.

A: It's all right. It's not bad. Pose was a legend while I was there. I didn't get an opportunity to play with him at Xavier, but coach Prosser and the people who coached him always talked about him.

Although a blended orgasm will offer a woman plenty of pleasure, the truth is that all orgasms are created equal. It is risky to suggest that one type of orgasm is better than another, or that women who don't reach vaginal orgasm easily are less sexually attune than women who do. Freud himself once described a clitoral orgasm as "immature," suggesting that vaginal orgasms are the true goal of sexual fulfillment. Talk about pressure! Women often have a hard enough time relaxing and enjoying sex without feeling like their natural responses are "immature" or not good enough.
Assemblywoman Connie Wagner (D-Paramus) introduced the legislation earlier this month, which would distribute Teterboro land among South Hackensack, Moonachie, Little Ferry and Hasbrouck Heights, according to the report.

Republicans will insist that President Obama bears exclusive responsiblility for America's economic infirmaties -- never mind the economy's critical condition when he took office -- while Democrats counter that he can't be held accountable in any detail, since if only the GOP had backed the president's miraculous policies the cure would be complete by now.

Yes, a Security Council resolution could be useful if it helps smooth the rough transition out of tyranny — not only in post-Assad Syria, but across the Arab world. But Washington has now spent months getting us here — handing the lead to the Europeans, who promptly put the Gulf Arabs in front (albeit, some say, while still pulling the strings). And “here,” now that the Arab League has unsurprisingly proved no match for Assad’s butchery, is back at the Security Council.

Use all your senses: Judging beer is a science, and Pat Daniels -- one of the most knowledgeable tasters around -- offers an excellent guide: bjcp.org/docs/How_to_Judge_Beer.pdf. "All five human senses can and should be used when judging officially or casually," says Daniels, a bartender at McNulty's Bier Markt. And yes, that includes hearing: "I know what you're thinking. How can one's ears contribute to the overall beer-tasting experience? When judging or casually drinking from beer poured from the bottle, I have started the process with many styles such as a highly carbonated Belgian Gueuze and Tripel that should present the sound of massive amounts of CO2 escaping from the bottle (like popping champagne) after being opened. Unfortunately, my ears are the first to detect that such a bottle has gone flat and lost this sought-after carbonation that helps makes the style."

If there is a connection between the timing of Mr. Johnson's arrest and the investigation into Mr. Nicholson, that's a real problem. Police have long focused on Mr. Johnson in the Barnes case, but they had not moved forward with an arrest, despite strong public pressure to do so. It would be terrible if, after all these months, authorities took action without having all the evidence they will eventually need.

Louis Vuitton set up shop on the rue Neuve des Capucines in 1854, describing himself as a "packager," with the tagline "Specialty in the Packing of Fashions." In 1896, George Vuitton, Louis' son, created the LV logo and monogram by which the company is now globally identified. Pamela Golbin, curator of the Les Arts Décoratifs exhibition (www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr; until Sept. 16), draws a comparison between Jacobs and Charles Frederick Worth, who, as the world's first couturier, created and established a whole new way of dressing for the emerging bourgeoisie. "Two innovators, both rooted in their respective centuries, advanced an entire industry," she says. "Two creators each in his own language appropriated cultural codes and trends in order to shape the history of contemporary fashion." This, in turn, informed Vuitton's methods and insured his success in creating luggage for this new customer, who could need as many as 10 trunks to transport everything from nightwear to evening gowns and shooting kit.

Two years later, history looks likely to repeat itself. Mujica is not running against Lipinski again, but he is the chief advisor to the Chicago Police officer, Farah Baqai, who is. Mujica, in fact, sat at the table with Baqai when she and Lipinski met with the Sun-Times Editorial Board.

That's clear when we meet Chelsea, a waitress in a bar, just after she's "power-slurped a worm" out of a bottle of tequila and wound up under arrest for DUI. After flirting with a mannish fellow inmate played by Dot Marie Jones (so wonderful as Coach Bieste on "Glee"), she prays to vodka to save her, promising to clean up her act.
Now, he is embarked on another uphill fight in hopes of preventing future tragedies. The crux of that fight means getting signs posted restricting the road from use by big trucks.
Next up: the Delaware fire station, where Fisher was full of appreciation and questions, about the work, the trucks, equipment and safety, the food and, especially, the pole. So the firefighters let him try it.

That was the moment when many a baseball fan began to see the game for what it really is – a business, with labor (the players) and management (the owners) more than willing to ignore the gauzy romance of America's pastime for the reality of cold, hard cash.
The changing nature of the campaign is also a boost for Tim Pawlenty, the successful two-term governor of a very liberal state, and possibly for another ex-governor, Jon Huntsman, depending on who he decides to run as.
The ball rocketed onto the green, slammed against the flagstick and disappeared from view. Back on the tee, Johnson high-fived playing partner Ian Poulter, celebrating the first ace at the Open since Thomas Levet's in the final round at Turnberry two years ago.
Less successful was English's version of surf and turf ($36), the crossroads between steak and seafood. It's something of a signature dish for him, cutting a pocket into a strip steak and stuffing in blue cheese and fried oysters. These are some of my favorite foods, so the combination held great promise. But the meat was lukewarm and the oysters were close to room temperature, which isn't a pleasant state for fried oysters. What should have been three aces turned into a losing hand.
It isn't done at the Lark in West Bloomfield, which is known for its service. "We are firm believers in having things written down. No matter how good a restaurant or how good a server you are, there's still room for human error" when people rely on memory, said manager Adrian Lark.
“We’re losing business .... because of traffic, and we know what our competitors are saying.”
Lithium ion batteries, the type found most often in portable devices, are made up of three main components -- an anode, a cathode and electrolyte. 3M's new product is a silicon-based anode that replaces graphite anodes now on the market, Milker said. The increase in power and capacity results when the silicon anode is paired with a specialized cathode 3M previously developed and has been making for several years, he said.

Questions to ponder while wondering if the Blues can avoid a home-ice letdown after such an excellent road trip:
By noon Thursday, the scene outside the Prince Street building whose basement was to be searched was a hive of police and curiosity-seekers, some of whom remembered the fear that ran through the neighborhood after Etan's disappearance. Etan was declared legally dead in 2001, but nobody has been charged in the case.
"It usually takes 40 to 50 days to ship beef from the U.S. to Korea. As we have some time, we will see how things go before we decide about future purchases," said Kang Young-il, a general manager at Home Plus, which is a unit of Britian's Tesco Plc.
Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace and Gromit cartoons, miss the boat with this animated outing. "Pirates" is stuffed with big-name voice actors (Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek, Brendan Gleeson, Imelda Stanton, Anton Yelchin and Jeremy Piven), but it's a movie that's entirely too late to the pirate party to offer much in the way of fresh gags. The plot centers on a lackluster pirate captain (Grant) who manages to capture Charles Darwin and who is then talked into setting sail for Britain by Darwin. Though it's amusing in small doses, this is the first Aardman film to suffer a serious shortage of sight gags, the first where the whimsy feels forced and the strain shows. Rated PG; mild action, rude humor, language. 1 hour, 28 minutes. By Roger Moore.
Still, is seems that migrants may not need Homeland Security to tell them just how dangerous it is out there. The path to the U.S. border is fraught with violence. Last year, more than 100 corpses were uncovered in mass graves in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Many of the victims were believed to be Central American migrants headed north. A year earlier, 72 migrants were kidnapped and killed in the same area. Drug cartels are increasingly blamed for much of the bloodshed.

"Hardly sounds like one who would become President of the United States, the most powerful man in the greatest, most powerful country in the history of the world, does it? It seems against all odds… … almost miraculous?"
“I want to help the team,” Valdespin said. “If they need a pinch-hitter, a pinch-runner, whatever, I’ll be there.”
Tentative entrees that were sometimes underseasoned and unimaginative. Small plates and appetizers may be the way to have a better experience here. However, sometimes the smaller plates seemed too busy, with all kinds of flavor components that made the food tough to match with wine.
"We think mustaches are really fun and silly," she said. At the wedding reception, they attached the photo series with daisy garlands to a white screen. An outdoor spring wedding with bridesmaids wearing yellow rain boots proved a "perfect" plan.
"That was an expense we didn't anticipate," said Dietz, who also travels with Douglas on her frequent trips to Florida.

“For complimentary and alternative medicine, it seems that some people believe what they want to believe, arguing that it does not matter what the data show; they know what works for them,” Offit writes. Under these circumstances, he concludes, “it would make sense for NCCAM to either refrain from funding studies of therapies that border on mysticism such as distance healing, purgings, and prayer.”
In New York, Spanish Harlem means a predominantly Latino neighborhood. At New York Flavor, it means a succulent sandwich of nicely seasoned steak, tomatoes and red onions on a baguette spiced with a creamy green chimichurri sauce ($8.99).

Another Portland park ranger told police that the two rangers were confronting O'Donnell about allegations that he had been exposing himself and harassing female hikers in Forest Park when he pulled out a six-inch knife and allegedly attempted to attack both rangers.
This new federal tactic targets what skeptics have long said was the soft underbelly of state-level medical pot laws: the fact that "prescriptions" can't be filled at a pharmacy. To fill that void, a loose network of growing cooperatives and clubs sprouted in many communities. Some were decidedly casual about whom they served; in response, about a half-dozen states began to regulate the outlets.
The award ceremony takes place at 10 a.m.
QUOTE TO NOTE: "I have to find a way to be more consistent. This was better than my last start. Hopefully my next start will be better than this." -- RHP Ubaldo Jimenez, who threw 113 pitches while giving up four runs in six innings Wednesday night in his loss to Kansas City.

Meanwhile, thousands like Brian, a wannabe physical therapist, wait. And hope. And dream.
He wasn’t entirely blameless. He allowed a leadoff double to Jose Bautista and hung a breaking ball to Edwin Encarnacion to give up a one-run lead in the sixth, but it probably wasn’t asking too much for Gregg to retire the No. 9 batter and keep the Orioles in the game.
But in 1997, he said, the league invited players to attend an NFL-sponsored seminar on financial responsibility.

First, always use your coupons to buy something already on sale. Second, collect coupons in multiples so you can buy in bulk.
One good source of money may be selling individual stocks. Many investors hang onto stocks because they don't want to pay the 15 percent capital gains tax. But Slott says the likelihood of a coming boost to that rate makes it doubly sensible as a way to pay for the conversion. "You'll never see a rate as low as 15 percent again in your lifetime, I don't think," he says. The top capital gains tax rate is currently set to revert back to 20 percent next year.
"So if you wiped out that activity, you just about got that park number you need."
Most college teams, including Princeton, play fifteens rugby, a version with longer matches and 15 players per side instead of seven. Though sevens rugby is quite popular worldwide, it is traditionally played in the summer when college teams are not in season.
A fountain might sound like a surprising addition when you're thinking water conservation, but even though recirculating fountains lose some water to evaporation and splash-out - the East Bay Municipal Utility District estimates that about 1 to 4 gallons per square foot of water per year gets lost to evaporation from pools - it still uses a lot less than the water lost to a large turf grass lawn, and the pleasure that people take in the sound of water can be well worth the trade-off.
The companies are also subject to limits on executive pay and corporate expenses. Italy's Fiat Group SpA can increase its stake in Chrysler if it produces a new engine in the United States or a car that gets 40 miles per gallon.

Beebe runs Sailaway Charters (sailorskip.com), taking groups of up to six people for two-hour nature cruises where he demonstrates the techniques of oystering, crabbing and shrimping. He also runs fishing charters and is a fisherman/shrimper involved in the cleanup effort.

It sounds very big. I'd like to leave a legacy where some of my students — I won't say all — have love and respect for our music. That's a fundamental thing I'd like them to understand, not just a way of making a living or a lot of name, but go deep into music and keep it alive. To keep an age-old culture with its depth, its feeling, its whole aspect is not very easy. Because now especially the world has become so commercial — it is do it now as soon as you can, make a name, make a record. So whether it is classical Western or Indian, I think it has the same problem. It's hard in these modern days to have students who have the love and respect for the tradition.

A bigger corporate presence at Team NEO won't change what local business groups are doing to keep companies here and help them grow, said Dan Colantone, president and chief executive of the Greater Akron Chamber.

My experience (at Tyler JC in Texas) was big for me. I had the grades coming out of high school but not the exposure. A lot of people believed I could play Division 1 basketball, but I never got the chance.

Locally, San Diego State linebacker Miles Burris fits the running theme of being scheme-flexible - he can play outside or middle in a 4-3 and projects as more of an inside option in a 3-4 defense, which the Chargers run.

Shurmur: "I think that what you do is, you pick them, you bring them in, you work with them and then you confirm what you thought and then you move forward. I think there are always some surprises. Who would have predicted that Jason Pinkston would have played every snap, picked where he was a year ago? That is why you pick the guys you like, that you think can make your club at the positions you pick them at. Now that we have chosen these guys, and there is reasons why, once we get them here and work with them, that is probably a much better question now, after we go through some of the practice time here in the spring."
“I'm proud to be a part of this moment. This sets the precedent for all of you to get through the door," Forest Park coach Greate White said to his team after Judd's signing.
Many of Laurie Berkner's groupies may still be in diapers, but they are as passionate about her music as any Springsteen fan. "I love Laurie!" squeals Ava, a precocious 3-year-old who has already been to two of her concerts and has tickets for her show tomorrow at Carnegie Hall (tickets are still available for the later performance). She'll bring her big brother, her mom, her dad and of course, a stuffed teddy bear "to put on my head when Laurie sings 'Pig on Her Head.' That is the best song ever."

The monkey's hands were very soft, very velvety as they danced over my neck and shoulders. The creature was chattering gently, right next to my ear. Then it tugged. I tugged back. The monkey tightened its grip and pulled harder. Not exactly the story I'd planned to write: Padangtegal Ubud, Bali - Primate Garrotes Writer in Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. But there I was in the surreally mystical refuge of macaca fascicularis - the Balinese or long-tailed macaque monkey - being strangled to death by two little hands and four shiny strands of red coral.
"Not very sexy stuff, but it certainly made you do your homework if you were going to communicate the message," Brodie says. "I didn't start with resorts or a car dealership where I could easily grasp the concept. I started with retaining walls and sound barriers and learned all about load-bearing reinforcing strips so it was a little bit different than I envisioned, but it was also really gratifying because I really got to learn about some really cool things."
Contador attended the closed-door hearing, which ended with him making a personal plea of innocence to the arbitrators. The panel also included German law professor Ulrich Haas, nominated by Contador’s side, and Geneva-based lawyer Quentin Byrne-Sutton, selected by the UCI and WADA.
Pacifica resident Howard Hall was among those who wrote to tell Fed officials how he had run up $15,000 in card debt after he lost his job in 2001, fell behind in his payments and saw his 8.9 percent rate shoot up to 29 percent - raising his monthly minimum payment to $400. Hall said he was able to climb out of debt because his wife was working and they were able to refinance their home. Now back at work, Hall asked what would happen to a single parent or someone without his advantages "once they fall into a credit death spiral."

We will lose the future if we do not make these investments."
If you want to get more specific, the Orioles need to have a solid pitching effort and they must play major league defense today. That probably means Buck Showalter will have to sacrifice some offense and play Ryan Flaherty at third and use Wilson Betemit as the DH, but since he doesn't let me make out the lineup card, we'll wait and see.

Notes: Thompson suffered a shoulder injury last spring and had surgery. He also has undergone surgery for an appendectomy. It would seem unlikely the two procedures would have anything to do with him having a heart attack. ... Riley noted Thursday that Thompson had gone through some difficult physical issues to reach the point where he would be scrapping for a spot in the defensive line rotation when spring ball starts March 12. (There are three practices before spring break). ... "I was so proud of him. He's come a long way since he got here,'' said Riley. "I just enjoyed being around him. He had that great, great smile. Everybody liked Fred, is the best way to say it. He was a big 'ol guy. Fun to be around. ... he was like the perfect teammate.''

Manahan set the next status hearing in the case for April 7.
— CULTURE AND ARTS: Don't worry, the debt crisis isn't going to shut down the Louvre in Paris or the Vienna State Opera House. Culture will play a central role in European life for the foreseeable future. But how much of it should be financed by the government? That's a question being asked in many European capitals as budgets are being tightened. As part of its austerity drive, Spain's new conservative government has eliminated the Culture Ministry as a self-standing institution, merging it with education and sports. A program to subsidize Spanish cinema — which made a name for itself around the world with Oscar-winning directors such Pedro Almodovar — has been scrapped. In Sweden, the government has decided to gradually dismantle a subsidy program that provided lifelong income guarantees for artists seen as particularly important to Swedish culture.

We've got new work rules (CBA) about what he can and can't do with our players, and we're going to make the most of it. What we're finding out is that ... man, we can do something even better than we did before, because these rules make us focus on some things we didn't do before.

At Calvin Klein, Mr. Zucchelli hit upon the idea of making foam clothing after seeing a book of works by John Chamberlain, an artist who worked with foam sculptures. At a trade show in September in Europe, he came across a booth set up by a manufacturer of foam used to cushion bike seats. It hadn't been used in clothing. It took six months from start to finish to create the foam clothes for Calvin Klein, "the longest it's ever taken" to make goods, compared to two weeks for a typical item, Mr. Zucchelli says.

Since the statute of limitations for civil rights violations has long since expired, Gilbert said some of the discussion involved the basis for a federal case, assuming there's evidence to warrant moving forward. "We told Mr. Perez that we're not looking to put people in jail," Gilbert said. "We're looking for some answers and acknowledgment that this evidence is compelling. We're researching whether, within the Justice Department, there's some kind of fact-finding process that's designed to further justice, but not prosecute."
Blackledge's results are "significant," said biologist Brent Opell, a respected spider researcher at Virginia Tech University. "He does a lot of good work. He keeps thinking of ways to move the understanding of threads and orb webs further along."
Indeed, Prince seems to covet the freedom afforded to jazz musicians who reinterpret their material nightly. His choice of support acts was telling: talented jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding and jazz-soul singer Hathaway. There was some head-scratching among fans when these names were announced, but Prince was sending a message -- come to the concert expecting stunning musicianship and something not unlike a jazz performance, and you won't be disappointed. And as strange as it was to hear scat singing in an arena, Spalding's too-brief set was a thrill. The bassist's four-piece jazz act simmered straight through their show, and Spalding's own songwriting was ambitious. Hathaway's set was sleepier, but had its exciting moments -- like her cover of Luther Vandross' "Forever, For Always, For Love," which climaxed in a guitar solo.
Reines, who will serve as auditor until a new charter government takes office in January, said he had no immediate plans to fire any other employees.
Frustrated by Christie’s rhetoric that the tax would hurt small business owners along with the wealthy, Democrats devised what they thought was a compromise — tax true millionaires, and use the money for senior and disabled taxpayers who needed it most. Christie, who never intended to sign any such tax, was angered more by the timing of the Democrats’ announcement: a half hour before he officially rolled out his "Cap 2.5" property tax reform agenda that opened up a second front in his war with lawmakers. He wasn’t happy with Sweeney springing it on him, and in private Christie made sure he knew it.
1. Left tackle. David Diehl is the incumbent, but he won’t line up there to start the preseason.

Their relationship has been through some rough patches. There have been "infidelities." The first being a brown monkey named Mandela. Mandela was a world traveler, having gone with us when we visited the Dominican Republic when Big Bits was only 5 months old. The little monkey was hugged as we took off from St. Louis on a cold February day and sat on a shaded table as we hung out by the pool for a week, keeping a constant eye on Big Bits and even letting a little green lizard sit on his head for everyone's amusement. Mandela got his name in the Dominican, as one of the pool girls thought it was sad that we were calling our child's favorite toy Monkey (we aren't that imaginative when it comes to naming toys either it seems).

Even under the best of circumstances, the setback will likely sideline Pineda until at least June. The worst case scenario is that follow-up exams reveal damage that was missed in the first round of tests. After an examination in Tampa today, the Yankees decided to send Pineda to New York, where he is scheduled to visit with team doctor Christopher Ahmad on Monday. He will also undergo a dye-contrast MRI exam.

--A $20 billion fund that BP set up in August for individuals and private businesses that were affected by the spill. The fund, known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, pays for environmental damage, personal injury, cleanup and lost earnings. The fund so far has paid $2.7 billion to address nearly 168,000 claims. Nearly half a million individuals and businesses have filed claims, and those that settle with the fund give up their right to sue the company. If any of the $20 billion is left over, it goes back to BP.
From 2002 to 2004, the suit says, Cook and the firms he worked through collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees as Hill's accounts lost nearly $2 million in value.

Off they go to investigate, and we see, playing the role of Bramble Haus, the Lion and the Rose Victorian bed and breakfast inn, actually located on Northeast 15th Avenue, near Lloyd Center. Never mind the fact that the plotline says the victim ran from the bed and breakfast to the bridge because it was so close. Only us locals are likely to find her ability to race from the Lloyd District to Troutdale, barefoot and nightgown-clad, remarkable. But it's still pretty funny, nevertheless.

• Mike Acker, Rip City Project: But right now, the hardest part about watching the Blazers get eliminated in the first round in six games for now the third season in a row, is knowing that this team could have played better. Nicolas Batum and Rudy Fernandez were non-existent for all six games, Brandon Roy brought probably too much emotion for anybody to sanely deal with, Wesley Matthews was inconsistent, Andre Miller wasn’t on the floor at times when he probably should have been, Gerald Wallace failed to show up a few times and then we did show up he had his minutes cut short both times (more on that in a second), and LaMarcus Aldridge just wore himself out having to be the guy on offense and guard the un-guardable guy on defense.

I'm just shocked and dismayed to see these city and other county school districts that are in such disarray. I'm a high school graduate from the state of Nebraska. We had only four teachers in high school one year. I was able to graduate from a prestigious eastern university. I was an engineering manager all my life in the St. Louis area. I think it's crazy what's going on.

The plans for the Tustin Legacy project already incorporate methods to keep traffic low, but I will definitely work with the police to ensure they have all they need to keep our city safe.

Late in the afternoon, I took Grace to my older brother's house so my wife, Therese, could have some time to herself. My nieces Alexandra and Samantha set up Wii Fit and had me run a four-minute course a couple of times. We also played some other games. I love Wii Fit. Alexandra and Samantha kept telling me what a good job I was doing and that I was smaller than when they previously saw me. I appreciated the kind words more than they knew.

RE: Blues sale. I really want to get excited over the news that a sale is imminent, and part of me certainly is. However, the pragmatic side of me says "I've heard this one before." As I recall, they were going to have a new investor by the end of 2010, then again by Feb. or Mar. or something. In this informal setting, do you have anything additional to offer that suggests that this time around, yes, they actually meant it? Even just a gut feeling, since you are one of the people closest to the story?

No, what prompted the Zen brothers, Antonio and Messer Niccolo, to explore the old Norse routes of the North Atlantic was a desire for adventure and wealth, and a strong sense of pride for their embattled Venetian republic, whose foes at the time of their travels — the late 14th century — included the Genoese and the Turks.
This is the first in a four-part series of feature stories the St. Charles Journal is doing about local farmers.

The issue of tax increases had been a red flag for Republican negotiators, especially since all six GOP members of the debt panel had signed an anti-tax pledge.
Euphoria spread through the community in the days that followed, Martins said. Drug gangs had made attaining even basic services such as mail delivery and trash collection difficult, he said, so everyone sighed with relief when municipal workers scoured the slum, leaving Rocinha clean.
"It isn't every day that an experienced coach gets the chance to create a college wrestling program from scratch, but that's exactly the opportunity I've been blessed to receive at Maryville University," Denney said .

"Thank God for my wading boots, as there unfortunately is broken glass as well. Every single back eddy had trash floating in it," he said. "(Crawford's) biggest piece was an x-large Styrofoam ice chest with the end smashed off. It's pretty obvious that McDonald's and Subway both offer what must be considered prime river-food as their packaging is mixed in at most places. The other thing is there are as many cans and bottles underwater as there are on the banks! The bottom of the river in sections off of premium shore access is literally covered with cans and bottles."
Hundreds of thousands of people make San Francisco their home, and thousands more come in every day to work. Unlike farmers in flood plains or tornado corridors, who depend on their land for survival, most of us could live and work in less-risky places. We could go to, say, Minneapolis or Chicago or Phoenix, cities not likely to be devastated by natural disasters.
Coroner Fiona Wilcox said it was unlikely that the demise of code breaker Gareth Williams, 31, would "ever be satisfactorily explained," despite a 21-month police inquiry, and seven days of expert evidence to an inquest hearing.
It could even push the fish closer to extinction.
In the fall, Bingham tried writing to Mattel about adding a hairless doll to its Barbie line, but all she got in return was a form letter explaining that the company didn't use unsolicited ideas. So, just before Christmas, she and Sypin launched their Facebook page: "Beautiful and Bald Barbie! Let's see if we can get it made."
The answer: Hiring is one of the biggest challenges a manager faces. People definitely put their best foot forward in interviews. Therefore you have to rely on a variety of other factors, including situational responses. I favor the non-traditionalist or the creative one. But in the end, whether I'm looking at a good or bad resume, I usually follow my gut. I've been disappointed a couple of times, but generally I read people well.

With so many discounts up for grabs online, a hefty shipping charge at checkout can be an unwelcome surprise. You might even be annoyed enough to cancel the order and look for a better deal elsewhere. Your chances of succeeding wouldn't be half bad.
In the meantime, the Postal Service would get a cash infusion of roughly $11 billion, basically a refund of overpayments it made in previous years to a federal retirement fund; the agency could use the money to pay down debt and offer buyouts to 100,000 postal employees. It would be allowed to make smaller annual payments into a future retiree health benefits account, which currently amounts to more than $5 billion a year; get more flexibility to cut worker compensation benefits; and be required to establish a chief innovation officer to find new ways to bring in postal revenue.
For now, Harden will be missing from the Oklahoma City Thunder with a concussion, until the doctors say otherwise. He is listed as day-to-day after beginning tests under the league-mandated concussion policy on Monday in Oklahoma City. And Metta World Suspension will almost surely be missing from the Los Angeles Lakers with a sanction, until the NBA says otherwise.
QUESTION: Who do you think will win this World Series and why?

"Is the stadium in the foreground? Sure," Ortega said. "But so is the West Building."
Pete Prisco, CBSSports, B-minus: "Third-round corner Trumaine Johnson has the ability to be an immediate starter. He just looks the part, even if he played at small-school Montana. Taking corner Janoris Jenkins in the second round is a risk considering his background. He has talent, but can he stay out of trouble? Fifth-round receiver Chris Givens has the speed the Rams' offense needs on the outside. They actually traded down twice in the first round and ended up with a bounty of picks. They used those picks to improve a team that needed it. Their second pick (Brian Quick) and Jenkins are risky."
At about 9:15 p.m., detectives from the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crimes unit were en route to the scene on Otis Avenue in Tuckerton, Deputy Chief Michael Mohel said.
If you opt to spend the night, live music fills the air, divided between rowdy karaoke and pro live bands (Spencer “Gimmie Some Lovin’” Davis lives in Avalon and occasionally sits in with various bands). There are enough dance clubs (try the Chi Chi Club after 10 p.m.) and rowdy bars (the Marlin Club is the oldest and perhaps best bar in Avalon) to keep most partiers happy.
"We are a mobile society. In Essex County, a number of towns have common borders: Newark, East Orange, Irvington," he said, citing three of the cities with the highest gang populations. "The distinction upon municipal boundary lines doesn’t really exist."

The first set wasn't close. Papes held serve two straight times after losing the first two games in the second set to make the second set closer – he was down 2-3 at that point – but Benedict won the last three games to improve to 11-1 on the season.
Remember that students 9 years old and younger will need a second immunization in 21-28 days from the first immunization. The schools are planning to administer second doses in November, but dates haven't been set.
Then again ... points are precious ... up and down your wing ... 60 minutes ... Richie, Ronnie, Bass ... skate boys, skate!
Aldridge, Batum and Przybilla will all tell you that McMillan is the same coach who averaged nearly 51 regular-season victories between 2008-2011. He's coaching, as usual. Most, but not all, of the team is following. What's obviously absent is Brandon Roy's leadership, which held every corner of the locker room accountable. And while I've wondered, at times, if McMillan is a forever guy in Portland, I can't pin this season on him.

The logical and overwhelming consensus is that because the Blues and Kings ranked 1-2 in team goals-against average and because their season series involved four shutouts — including a 0-0 double shutout decided by a shootout — this will be a low-scoring series. Tight defensive hockey has been the trend this spring outside of the Flyers-Penguins goalfest, and Brown said he expects that to continue.

The total amount of his daily caffeine intake has to be considered. I feel that a boy his age should not be relying on stimulants to keep him awake during the day. A checkup with the family doctor is a good idea. And if he stops his caffeine tablets, he should do so by slowly decreasing the dose over a period of two weeks.

But (and it's a very important but) support for the death penalty, in Connecticut and elsewhere, is not as robust as it looks. When Quinnipiac asked a different question  "Which punishment do you prefer for people convicted of murder, the death penalty or life in prison with no chance of parole?"  only 46 percent favored the death penalty. An equal number chose life without parole. Death penalty opponents have an opening they haven't had for some time.

The most obvious design element of The Bent Brick will be the waiting area, which has a floor-to-ceiling installation made from unfinished 4-by-6 wood blocks surrounded by an irregularly shaped banquette. The wood block idea was inspired by my 7-year-old son, Mack, who was stacking wood in the backyard and doing it wrong. It looked sort of like what you would end up with if you were playing a game of Jenga, kind of airy, more sculptural than structural. And it occurred to me that would be a good idea for the new place. So I took a few photos and showed them to Mark, with the original thought of using actual pieces of firewood. That had a feel that was a little too lodge-y and rustic, so we switched it over to the rough lumber pieces for a more modern feel.

Signs of movement toward renewed cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have Israeli officials on edge. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organization committed to its destruction and has shunned negotiations. In the wake of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' efforts last fall to sidestep negotiations with Israel and seek United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state, it is easy to see this as another ominous sign for the prospects for peace. But there is another possibility at work. If Mr. Abbas can capitalize on the regional developments in political Islam sparked by the Arab Spring and exert a moderating influence on Hamas' extremism, he could do much more to realize his goals than he ever could have achieved through his end-run to the UN.

The top prospects: There isn't a Ndamukong Suh or Marcell Dareus-type talent who will go in the first two or three picks, but LSU's Michael Brockers, Mississippi State's Fletcher Cox and Penn State's Devon Still look like sure-fire first-rounders. Dontari Poe of Memphis is a massive space-eater at nose tackle. North Carolina's Quinton Coples and South Carolina's Melvin Ingram are two of the top defensive end prospects in this draft.

Experts seem to agree that there are six elite players at the top of this draft. The No. 6 slot might lose some value to the Rams if cornerback Morris Claiborne or running back Trent Richardson fell to that spot after Blackmon and Matt Kalil. The Rams already have veterans in the lead RB and CB roles, so that might prompt the front office to trade down out of the pick for additional assets. Or the Rams could move up IF the football staff falls in love with Blackmon. How the staff assesses these high-end prospects during the weeks ahead should help Jeff Fisher and Les Snead chart their course.

No matter how magnificent the dunes, it was time to counteract a week of rough motels and dusty all-day drives with a little luxury. There are few better places in Africa to do this than the area around Sossusvlei, home to some of the continent's ritziest hide-outs. The priciest of all, Wolwedans — a resort composed of several lodges and ultra-luxurious tent camps — is rumored to have refused Brangelina and their entourage rather than rebook its other guests. Cheaper but still wonderful is the Sossus Dune Lodge, which provides the easiest access to the famous dunes.

Already, many investors have shifted their focus to Friday's monthly jobs report, when economists expect the U.S. economy to have added about 170,000 jobs in April.

Such issues motivate his novels — "Little" (1995), "The Hiawatha" (1999) and "The Translation of Dr. Apelles" (2006) — which, shifting between past and present, the reservation and the city, play with our preconceptions of Indian culture, what he dismisses as "trauma porn."

Nothing wrong with dreaming. Heck, three NFL teams drafted four rookie starters just last year. Of course, those teams had a collective 40 picks to pull off the feat. The Bears have six selections, and they are choosing late in rounds as punishment for an 11-5 season that included hosting - and losing - the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers.

The effort, led by the city and Ohio City Near West Development Corp., also includes planning for events leading up to the market's birthday. A report outlining recommendations for the market could be finished in late March or early April.
To get the bedbugs-are-coming word out, we can think of an even better strategy than surveys of pest-control companies that are then sent to the press. (Newspapers, after all, are so yesterday.) Anyone watch GoatCam? What about a bedbugcam? It should be easy enough — given what people will do for a minute of fame and how widespread the creatures reportedly now are — to find someone to offer a bed that could be filmed round-the-clock at high magnification.
Matsui said he hoped that people and areas affected by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami -- which triggered the crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant -- would recover from the disaster.

Weight gain causes fatty acids to overflow into muscles and the liver, rather than stay in fat cells and cholesterol molecules where they are normally stowed, Plutzky says. In ways still not understood, scientists think that these fatty acids make muscle cells insulin-resistant, which makes them less able to absorb glucose, and that elevates blood sugar levels.

Are the Blazers interested in real answers on Oden? Are they willing to explain to their ticket-buying fan base what they think is happening with their center? Beyond that, is Oden himself getting an accurate picture? You certainly hope the answers are yes, but we've passed through the threshold of waving things off as just a "freak injury" long ago when it comes to Oden. You now have to wonder if the franchise's desire to justify Oden's as the No.1 pick three years ago is what's driving some of this.
In a flurry of NBA trade deadline activity on Thursday, the Blazers traded two players and received four. The moves pushed the Blazers' roster to 17 players, two over the league maximum.

GOP-leaning voters generally get this: Warning against the "European social democrat" model is one of Mitt Romney's better talking points. The problem for Mr. Romney is that he represents something of another European specialty: the dispassionate technocrat, data-driven, post-ideological, lacking in soul. GOP-leaning voters get that, too.

But the Internet is leveling the playing field again by offering a potentially high-profile public arena for anyone making music with a message.
Taking Italian flavors as a base, chef-owner Ricardo Sandoval mixes and matches with a flourish. The kitchen is particularly adept at pairing the unexpected sweet with the savory, as in the pizza with grape jam, duck confit, gorgonzola, spiced pecans, crispy sage and pears. The sweet jam and salty cheese delightfully complement the meltingly tender duck. Leek sweet potato soup is another complex treat, veering toward savory with a sweet undercurrent. The mac-n-cheese dinner also put a twist on traditional, topping not-too-cheesy cheddar and shells with grilled chicken breast, crumbly chorizo, rosemary, grilled onions, truffle oil and sweet apple.

As a candidate, Obama attracted 200,000 cheering fans at a speech in front of Berlin's Victory Column, and he won the Nobel Peace Prize after less than a year in office because of the belief that he had strengthened international cooperation.

He had pleading 1950s hits ("Please, Please, Please," "Try Me"), commanding 1960s ones ("Papa's Got a Brand New Bag," "Say It Loud! I'm Black and I'm Proud"), and grunted funk jams ("Mother Popcorn," "The Big Payback") in the 1970s, with the music made in the latter period in particular living on as Brown became the most sampled artist in hip-hop history. All the while, he burned through band members, whom he underpaid and mistreated, demanding more than they knew they could give.

2. May 13, 1977: The night I had my "Springsteen calling." It was supposed to be a concert by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes at the Monmouth Arts Center. But Southside was ill and couldn't perform, so Steve Van Zandt and Bruce headlined the Asbury Park All-Star revue. It was a combination of the Asbury Jukes, the E Street Band, Ronnie Spector with Van Zandt and Springsteen doing the lead vocals. This night I really felt the power and genius of Bruce Springsteen. Any show with Bruce was more than a concert, it was an event.

A sharp critic of modern poetry's obscurity, Gioia has sought an alternate route in the pleasures of narrative and traditional rhyme and meter. At their best, his poems remind us that story and song are inseparable from the words they're made of. But Gioia's fourth book is not his best: Rhymes clang, meters march, language lies flat: The "mildewed paper" of old letters "reeks of regret." When Gioia writes of a deceased child, and his own struggle to express his loss, we see how powerful his poems can be. Too often, though, there's too little beauty to pity. Grade: C
First, residents who oppose group homes are quick to say they would never discriminate against the mentally ill or developmentally disabled. But that's exactly what they seek to do.
Toni Malone's towering burgers may be the most ambitious in all of Los Angeles. Yet there are no contrivances here: no custom-ground meat blends, no willful denial of ketchup and no flavors fortified by what might otherwise amount to a chemistry experiment. Instead, the restaurant's signature burger is a tender, hand-formed turkey patty, a crispy lattice of turkey bacon, a firmly fried egg, a single slice of cheese, sweet mashed yams and wilted collard greens on a gently toasted sesame-seed bun. It's a triumph of maximalism, a burger in expert balance despite its seeming overabundance of ingredients.

Later, Staci wakes up. The two new mothers are no longer captives, they've presumably ascended to heaven with their babies. It's revealed all along the women had been in Purgatory, after having died on the operating table of abortion clinics. But because Staci attempted to miscarry even after a second chance at motherhood, and because she never accepted the error of her ways until she experienced the physical joy of giving birth, of seeing her children for the first time, she will be doomed to eternity in Hell.

Financially, this system is paying for itself, just slowly. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power charges me less than half a penny per gallon, so technically, gray water has saved me only $95 in water costs so far. But it's also reduced my sewer charge by about one-third, saving me an extra $3.30 per month. In drought-prone Southern California, gray water feels like the right thing to do. It's been the easiest, most sensible, hassle-free, sustainable system I've put in place at my house.
Take his chapter on chicken soup. There, Stone tells us, cooking the soup releases an amino acid that resembles the drug acetylcysteine, which is used to treat bronchitis and other respiratory ailments. The vitamins and nutrients in chicken soup slow the growth of mucus-stimulating white blood cells called neutrophils. And new Japanese research shows that the old-fashioned remedy may fight high blood pressure, too.

In addition, Hagerty's ex-husband, Jeffrey Bakely, who now lives in Philadelphia, said the Enquirer offered to pay him $5,000 to use his name and photograph in its publication. The fee was reduced to $2,500 when he refused to have his picture taken, although he has not received any money, the police reports state.

Israel's repertoire is built on 10 starters -- oysters on the half-shell, polenta, soup and assorted salads -- plus a handful of entrees that includes a daily pasta and an excellent grilled fish option. And there's always a risotto of the day -- creamy-firm Italian arborio rice mingled with duck, salty ham, wild mushrooms and other interesting ingredients.
A: I don't know how sick they thought I was. I was very sick. Advanced lymphoma is a very serious illness. Fortunately I had a treatable variety and I responded well, but when I first started that wasn't known. That I would respond so well wasn't known.

Such obstacles never seem to faze Daigle and friends. They go about the act of artistic archeology like missionaries who won't be distracted. If this means preserving every original note and word (always in English), so be it.
Police departments are constantly creating cases for the public access counselor because of a controversial provision in the new law that requires agencies to seek permission every time they want to redact information considered to be private — such as birth dates and addresses in police reports. But police officials often interpret exemptions too broadly, according to the attorney general's office.
"So that's where I'm going to start, whether it's for a year, five years or six months," he says. "I see myself bouncing around a lot for the next 10 years. This'll be like the first chapter."
That's good news. The Oregonian's project most closely resembles (at the moment) the J-Lab project at the Seattle Times. That project has already resulted in some partners seeing traffic increases of up to 400%. A survey conducted by J-Lab and released today, finds that the Seattle Times project, now over a year old, has garnered significant public support. The report says that 8 out of 10 respondents appreciated the Times for helping them find local blogs and news sites.
The Vintner's Reserve and the Avant each have received high marks from wine critics, so I thought it would be interesting to sample both.
All of which — the information gathering, the meetings, the workouts — brought everyone involved to Monday morning. Fox and Elway were in Elway's office, killing time and hoping for the best as it was clear that Manning was close to making a decision.
"This is the CVC low-balling in an effort to create a negotiating position rather than something that would create a first-tier standard," said Ganis. He was part of the Rams' negotiating team on the original lease and has served as a consultant on other stadium projects but is not involved in the current negotiations.
Oregon shot 50 percent from the field and got 18 points from Olu Ashaolu to pull within four, 51-47 at halftime. But there's no way the Ducks, who averaged 73 points per game coming into Sunday, could keep up the pace, right?

The remodeling of the ironically named Upbeat Studio (Cake’s music is rarely cheery) helps to account for the seven-year gap between 2004’s "Pressure Chief" and "Showroom." But it wasn’t the only reason for the break.
It feels like high school journalism can make a difference, Alison said. Her time spent on the story included reading a 900-page document on safe decibel levels. But it was worth it, she said.
Philadelphia's scoring play started with some remarkable ballhandling by Michael Farfan, Gabriel's brother, who eluded Heath Pearce and Oswaldo Minda as he dribbled up the right side toward the end line. From there he tried to send a low cross across the goal mouth to Adu. Fortunately for the Union, Riley slid in to try to deflect the pass, only to leave the ball unattended at the left post. From there Adu used his left boot to tap it in.
PSAL boys 1, CHSAA boys 0: Brooklyn PSAL boys soccer had a standout year as Tilden reached the Class A quarterfinals after going undefeated in Brooklyn A Central.

SACRAMENTO — It isn't enough these days for certain state lawmakers to defend their voting records when seeking reelection. Some also have to explain arrest records.
It is a case that has become remarkably high-profile — including with the addition of Webb — and one that seems to have a lot of smoke on its surface. The police investigation was sluggish, files went missing, even a mysterious notation surfaced on the back of one police report that appears to reference Vanecko's relationship to the mayor. In appointing a special prosecutor, Toomin wrote that the public's perception of impropriety matters most. By making Webb the special prosecutor, Toomin made clear that he considers the matter grave.

Holland, who had a five-hit shutout the last time he started at Progressive Field on June 4, gave up five hits, one earned run and struck out six over 7 1-3 innings.
Marreese Speights (8.9 ppg, 6.3 rpg) has stayed in the Grizzlies starting lineup even with Zach Randolph coming back from a knee injury because of what he brings to the table. He's got enough range that you have to guard him while he faces the basket, and that opens up the block for Gasol and creates driving lanes for Rudy Gay and Mike Conley.
Clackamas County Service District No. 1 serves Happy Valley, Damascus and a large portion of urban, unincorporated north Clackamas County. It also serves the city of Milwaukie as a wholesale customer through the Kellogg Creek plant.
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the expanded observer mission and Annan's proposal "represents the last opportunity to secure a solution to the crisis in Syria."
Maybe it's the slightly soulless nature of motion-capture films (though that's been greatly improved upon since the dead-in-the-eyes days of "The Polar Express"), but while the adventurous aspects are slam-bang, the characters don't connect in the same way Indy does. Spielberg is such an imaginative storyteller that "Tintin" can't help but be fun to watch. You just wish he'd slow down and let us catch our breath a little every now and then.
"I was throwing post routes and trying to overthrow him and I couldn't," Ponder said. "The guy is so fast. He's so athletic. I think he's going to be a great asset to our X position. And he's a great guy. I've been hanging out with him. He's real down to earth and so athletic."

Intel did not rely on new incentives included in a job bill signed this week by Gov. Jan Brewer when deciding to expand in Arizona, executives said.

He pointed to the word "math" as an example — he can't get the "th" sound down. He's sure his terrible handwriting didn't help in the essay portion of previous competitions (it's done online for nationals), and he had struggled with the literature test in the past.

In the past few months, state workers snatched nearly 300 geese from the fairways and ponds of a golf course next door and sent them to Maui and the Big Island on helicopters and a Coast Guard plane.
One rock-star exception is Lalou Bize-Leroy, who became one of the highest profile women in the wine world when she became co-director of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti (DRC) in 1975. Though DRC soared to new heights — at least price-wise — under her leadership, she left after a series of family disputes and now focuses on her own company, Domaine Leroy.

I think that the rail authority must be preserved, at least as a role model for the other government agencies. It must be given reasonable financing and some easily done duties, such as generating one new project a year. Of course, there is a risk that some hot head in the authority will try to start building a real railroad, but I am sure this person will be rendered harmless by the forces inside the rail authority. Nobody with good sense cuts the branch on which he sits. And until now, the rail authority has demonstrated an astonishing self-preservation instinct.
The Politico poll found the gender gap narrowing. Obama had a 7-percentage-point lead among women and Romney had a 7-percentage-point lead among men.

What followed was a series of battles -- often behind closed doors -- over the terms of the deal, the location of the complex and its design. There were sudden reversals, prolonged negotiations for property -- the county ended up paying far more for land than had been estimated -- and a skirmish with Cleveland officials over conditions at Public Auditorium.
The show took its time getting to the "Star Trek" material, and then dwelled on it lightly. Shatner clearly wanted to open up other, less-familiar corners of his "World." There were sketches of his mother and father, a long story about driving a rabbi from Vancouver to Chicago, clips from a movie in which he played Alexander the Great and snapshots, both photographic and verbal, of his current wife and his three daughters from a previous marriage.

But that's only an advantage if your iPad can actually find AT&T LTE coverage. Nationwide, Verizon's LTE signal is easier to find than AT&T's. I had to drive closer to the city before I could properly test the new iPad on LTE.
It is the rare individual who has the wherewithal and the inclination to self-finance, yet shutting off or curtailing the ability of organizations such as PACs to raise money could result in limiting the candidate pool to those who can write their own checks.

When Christopher Hitchens explored "the superior funniness of men" and the "inferior funniness of women" in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, he ruffled feathers. Today, his theory seems a moot point especially in Chicago, where the female stand-up scene is burgeoning. It's filled with a wide array of comics who have their eye on the prize, as well as others who are out there simply for the fun of it.

Professional astronomers never confirmed his observations, but Lowell's ideas created a sensation. Before long, amateur observers reported seeing light signals from Mars. And in 1897, H.G. Wells, using Lowell's ideas as a premise, described a Martian invasion of Earth in his novel "The War of the Worlds."
“It’s only going to get worse this year,” Steinhauer said. He urged lawmakers to reestablish the so-called millionaires tax, saying the state’s wealthiest residents shouldn’t be getting a tax break when schools are looking in the cushions to pay for art teachers.
The group, run by three former Romney aides, also lured Republican mega-donor Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor who gave $8.6 million in 2011 to Republican super PACs (including American Crossroads and groups backing Newt Gingrich and former candidate Rick Perry), but nothing last year to the pro-Romney effort. Last month, he gave $100,000 to Restore Our Future, just three days after Romney's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary.

Barnes & Noble: various locations.
Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.
The Vikings have pursued a stadium subsidy for more than a decade, and no longer have a lease binding them to the Metrodome. Other cities coveting a new NFL franchise have watched closely.
"I've been surfing for 33 years and I've never seen Waimea this big," Bigelow said. "I need to get a bigger board."

“He shot the ball great and that's fabulous, and now he needs to get back on the boards,” Van Gundy said.
It is the unapologetic "older generation" here -­­ Joe's sharply defensive second wife, Vera (MaryAnn Thebus in crackling good form), and his now well-to-do best friend, Morty (Mike Nussbaum, beyond perfection, in what seems like a custom-made role), who easily steal the spotlight here. They explain that what seemed right at a time when it was Soviet soldiers in the forefront of the fight against Hitler and fascism, may look very different now. (In a fine bit of his own subterfuge, set designer Keith Pitts gives us an interior filled with Scandinavian modernist furniture, as if everyone here is stuck in a 1950s state of mind.)
Still, there are things to enjoy. Means (the son of Russell Means) overdoes it a little -- the whole film could be said to suffer from trying too hard, as with an odd sequence involving over-enthusiastic security guards -- but that's part of Buddy's personality. First-time actor Donathan Littlehair is entertaining as a somewhat-clueless WWFA chapter president. And Johnny Greybird is funny as the slightly cheesy master of ceremonies.
"I'll know right away," he said.
Survivor Archibald Gracie, in his popular account, described the lowering of lifeboats into the water with women and children, saying "it was now that the band began to play and continued while the boats were being lowered. We considered this a wise provision tending to allay excitement. I did not recognize any of the tunes, but I know they were cheerful and not hymns."
Corps officials first spotted and reported sporadic sheens in December, but believe the leaks have been occurring since June based on transfomer oil inventory records. The spill, near Pasco, Wash., was not dense enough to require immediate clean up actions on the river, regulators said.

SPORTS are tribal. We line up with our team, our school, our city; paint our faces Trojan colors, dye our hair Dodger blue.

"The Walking Dead" (9 p.m. Sunday, AMC): Daryl (Norman Reedus) sure had a bad time of it during last week's episode -- falling off that cliff and getting shot and all. Tonight's sixth episode of the second season is titled "Secrets," and that might be because Glenn (Steven Yeun) learns a couple.

But that's not enough. Cuyahoga County also needs a council that's prepared both to advise FitzGerald and to provide his new administration with smart oversight when the new government takes power on Jan. 1.

In fact, less than 2 percent of black-owned businesses in the state have more than five employees, the data shows. One in 10,000 have more than 500 employees. Part of the reason for this phenomenon is that most new black-owned firms are "nonemployer firms," which means they consist of only one person. Roughly nine in 10 black-owned firms fit this description, both in New Jersey and the rest of the nation. This trend is not new among African-Americans, but such firms multiplied at a much faster pace in the Garden State, which saw a 72 percent jump during the five-year window, compared to 13 percent for the nation, the data shows.

Young musicians are battling uphill. With each passing year, the "buzz" musicians at the conference get older and more established.

On the flip side, some major names were remarkably precise. The 2008 Migration Russian River Valley Chardonnay from Duckhorn was spot-on: 14.1 percent tested and on the label. And the 2006 Robert Mondavi Reserve Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon lists an alcohol of 15.5 percent, essentially the same as its tested result of 15.46. That seems painfully high for a wine that once landed in the mid-13s, but the number is accurate.

"He just got out of whack," Rays manager Joe Maddon said. "He couldn't throw a strike where he wanted to with the fastball. He has a great fastball, he just doesn't know where it's going all the time quite yet. I've seen that before with our other young pitchers, so he's going to be fine."
This sweet little sentimental song felt like we were hearing Javier for the first time, back in blind auditions last season. He’s still tender, smooth and soulful, and the song was fresh and subdued at the same time.
Accorsi, who communicates with Reese regularly via e-mail, said his successor never complained about the heat he was feeling. But the former GM knows it was there, and he knows it was made much more difficult with the Eagles stockpiling star free agents.
Northeast Ohio continues to have some of Ohio's lowest unemployment rates. Experts attribute lower joblessness to local economies that tend to be more diverse than in parts of the state dependent on one or two industries.
Where was I? Oh, yes: the world's all-time coldest wind chill. That's what you're going to be feeling at this point in an Obama second term. If you like his contempt for judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and representative democracy now, wait'll you see how "flexible" he'll get starting in January 2013. The CFPB appointment is not a small thing. Indeed, its new director, one Richard Cordray, embodies what's gone so disastrously wrong with American government: you'll have to be in compliance with him, but he doesn't have to be in compliance with anybody, whether the Senate or the Constitution. As I say somewhere in my recent book, you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life. More and more aspects of the citizen's daily existence are regulated by rules and officials both of which are ever more disconnected from any meaningful accountability to the people's representatives. As the president says, look for even more "flexibility" in a second term: more non-recess recess appointments, more executive orders, more bewildering innovations from the commissars of the hyper-regulatory state.
“You got to play well, you got to do things right and execute,” Flacco said. “We don't need a wake-up call. We're really not a team that needs that. That's tough to explain, but we have a great group of guys in there. We just didn't play well tonight.”
The space has a very Zen feel with walls covered in thin stone tile, heated concrete floors, and materials and colors found in nature. An oversized air bubble tub is the centerpiece of the room, inviting a relaxing bath while gazing out at the serene pond. A separate glass shower stall features a height-adjustable, multi-head shower as well as an overhead "rain" showerhead, evoking the true spa experience.

Other kicker notables are Danny Hrapmann (Southern Miss), David Teggart (Connecticut) and Blair Walsh (Georgia). Walsh had a fine three-year start to his career before a 21 of 35 unraveling on field goals as a senior.
In the end, the restaurant comes off as amateurish and not ready for prime time. I'm not expecting three-star service. But is it too much to ask for a little common sense? Or thoughtfulness? I'd love to get a cease-and-desist order to prevent servers from continually checking in to ask if everything is "great." And the $30 corkage fee for a restaurant with such a weak wine list isn't the swiftest move either.
The long financial battle between Fox Sports Midwest and AT&T is over, and the winner is neither - it's Cardinals fans who subscribe to AT&T's U-verse system.
After a heated debate, the county's board of supervisors voted 3-2 to ban new contracts with Arizona-based companies and review those that could be canceled. The county has more than $26 million in contracts with Arizona companies this year.

Emily once experimented with a photo, for instance, by rubbing it on a gravestone before it developed fully. Another time, she dropped a developing photo on the sidewalk and stomped on it to give it a random speckled pattern. One inadvertent experiment occurred when she tried to photograph a sunset from the roof of a five-story apartment building, stumbled and sent the Polaroid camera plunging to earth. She lost the camera and film, but a friend immortalized the smashed camera -- with a Polaroid photo of it.

In Baltimore City, that same family of an adult with a preschooler and a school-age child needs nearly $50,000, the report said, for a bare-bones budget.
God bless Stacey King - I couldn't have made it through the season without him. He's the color commentator for Comcast SportsNet, with a litany of Harry Caray-esque exclamations - "get me the hot sauce" and "too strong, too fast, too good" and such - that keep the whole thing fun, with a nod to his straight man, Neil Funk, the play-by-play announcer. I miss them when they're not on.
She covered a lot more ground on this occasion, from “Baby, I Love You” to “Chain of Fools” to “Day Dreaming” to “Freeway of Love.” The performance clocked in just under two hours.
Human migrants — especially those stopping by in yachts — are more attracted to Da Alfredo, a restaurant in the marina where people wait in line for pane cunzato, the house specialty, halfway between a sandwich and a pizza. Three women from the mainland let me join them at their table, where I wolfed down a pane cunzato topped with tuna, mozzarella and tomatoes. They advised me to order a delicious fresh melon and mulberry granita for dessert, then insisted on paying my bill. Happy people are generous people. So it goes on Salina.

For the bedroom, she bought a watermelon-red bed frame from Anthropologie and an illuminated midway sign from Pottery Barn.
øI was in my 20s at the time and had thought myself to be in good physical shape until I arrived at the class and discovered that I could barely get into the postures that other class members twice my age seemed to do with ease. In fact one man in the class was 68 and moved into the postures effortlessly. That experience was enough for me not to return.
"With the team that we have, if we get everyone healthy and our game coming together, I don't see why we can't accomplish that," Nichol said. "But we've worked hard all year and you really want home ice all the way through. Those are the little things that you work really hard to accomplish, and we're right there. It's ours to have, and we've just got to keep playing solid hockey.

It has been more than two years since McKee, a construction magnate who built WingHaven in O'Fallon, unveiled his $8.1 billion plan to redevelop two square miles of the near north side into office buildings, warehouses and thousands of new homes. The development has seen little progress since a nearly $400 million TIF was overturned in court in July 2010, and several other McKee projects have faced lawsuits over unpaid loans.

Award-winning journalist Carolyn Scott Kortge was 58-years-old when, sitting alone in the sauna after a workout at her athletic club in Eugene, Ore., she decided to perform a routine breast exam. Kortge discovered a small, hard lump in her left breast and, that day, scheduled an appointment with her doctor. He was concerned enough to order an immediate lumpectomy.
By the fall, the deteriorating economy had broadened the thirst for change from a base of Democratic Party regulars and anti-war activists to encompass a majority of the electorate. McCain's only chances for victory slipped away as the success of the surge he championed in Iraq was obscured by the economic collapse here at home. But looking back to the pivotal moments along the primary campaign trail last spring, it's clear that neither candidate could have possibly come this far without challenging their parties' conventional wisdom on a war that -- to most Americans -- barely seems to matter anymore.
"He was a big, friendly type of officer - the type of officer kids like to hang around," Hafkey said. "Everyone who knew him said this is one of those guys who had a huge heart."

I'm reading this morning's Town Talk on Feb. 22. The last article says if you can't play, don't. This is real sportsmanship. I thought this was not a game for just winning. It was to bring out the best in any kid and show them that they can have some self-esteem about other things. And the person who wrote this is probably one of those guys who gets out on the field and yells at the umpires because their son or daughter is not being shown at their potential. Give us a break, everybody. You don't always have to win.
"The Pirates! Band of Misfits" goes one step further. It tips the scales to favor adults over children.

On Saturday, after days of contentious negotiations, New York became the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage. With the state's population of 19 million, the new law doubles the number of Americans in same-sex marriage states.

A: Radioactive iodine is one of the most significant airborne contaminants released in a nuclear accident because it will accumulate to high levels in the thyroid gland of those who breath it in. Taking potassium iodide floods the thyroid with stable iodine, thus preventing the radioactive form from gathering in the gland. It protects only the thyroid, not other parts of the body, and does nothing to prevent harm from other radioactive elements released in a nuclear accident, such as cesium.

It's clearly not working. Washington has only succeeded in pushing drug cartels from Colombia to Mexico, and now -- increasingly -- from Mexico to Central America. If we drive them out of Central America, they will go to the Caribbean. It's a never-ending game that is costing billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of innocent lives.

While the microphone keys work a bit differently on the two platforms, they are basically similar. When the keyboard appears, ready for you to type, you can instead hit the microphone key and simply dictate what you want to say. The phones then send your spoken words to a remote server, which rapidly translates them into text and sends them back to the phone's screen. If corrections are needed, you make them by typing, though both platforms make this easier by indicating the likeliest errors, and suggesting alternatives.
DeVito, who arrived with wife Rhea Perlman, described the award as a great honor.
Dangerous conditions were not limited to New Jersey. Firefighters spent Monday battling a five-alarm brush fire at the former Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, and could continue to do so for the next two days, officials said.

The FBI is still analyzing the explosive, which was intended to be concealed in a passenger's underwear. Officials said it was an upgrade over the bomb that failed to detonate on board an airplane over Detroit on Christmas 2009.

“I’m not surprised he’s not running again because the word on the street was that he wasn’t re-electable,” Olson said of Hoffman. “It’ll be good for the city to have a new mayor and someone who isn't such a lightning rod for this divisiveness that has been pervasive in our community for the last few years."

Henry actually defeated Punk, albeit via countout. The two worked a really good match and Henry especially was in top form. Given the ending of the match, the big man has a rightful claim to a rematch, but it seems as if Punk may have someone else continuing to keep him busy for a while.

Some commentators have compared the pepper-spraying to police actions at Kent State, which is absurd. Four students died at Kent State. But it's also absurd to reflexively support what the police did, and not inquire how it happened.
Even though I'm mechanically ignorant, we were able to get her car restarted; she thanked me and we said our good-byes. But as I turned to leave, something held me back.

Yet the mental and social effects of both the betrayals and the hearings' aftermath aren't explored in depth, while precious time is eaten up by an overlong party.

That's a big issue. I know that multiple organizations have weighed in on it, and our mayor has been involved with discussions with the clinic.

All products that make health-related claims need some kind of clearance by the FDA. Cosmetics don't – unless they claim to treat specific problems such as dandruff or acne.

At its most basic, it’s the story of the people’s fickle love, and a patrician’s discomfort with the rough-and-tumble of pragmatic politics. A dense, thoughtful exploration of themes Shakespeare explored in plays from “Richard II” to “Julius Caesar,” it’s difficult drama with a thoroughly unlikable protagonist at its core.
"The Cuban government has monetized every part of the humiliating process of coming and going," said Ann Louise Bardach, a longtime Cuba expert and author of "Without Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington."

During that course, I was driving solo. Imagine a minivan full of passengers running into trouble – and the driver has zero experience reacting to a skid, to a sudden situation in front of the car, to a tire blowout, to hydroplaning, to a pothole.

While it would appear as if a player would have to fight for offensive chances, with junior Sharese Jones scoring 17.0 points a game this season, but Warncke said that just isn't so.
The mayor — who once called Vanderbeek a good friend, a mensch, and a lifelong partner of the city — has increasingly been at odds with the Devils over Newark’s contract with the team, negotiated by the previous administration of former Mayor Sharpe James. At issue was a dispute over the sharing of parking revenues, rent payments, and construction delays.
Matt Jolly and Russ Parsons, U.S. Forest Service ecologists, suggested last year that dead needles can ignite up to three times faster than the green needles of a healthy tree. Beetle-killed trees can burn more intensely and carry embers farther, Jolly said.
"In the past, I've had people each bring a dish, and I have spectacular appetizers from all over -- great olives, fine salamis, you name it, and all kinds of different drinks, alcoholic and nonalcoholic. So immediately when they come in, they have something to eat and drink while they fill in their ballots," Harry says. He prepares copies of a ballot for the major awards, such as best actor and best picture.

* Return of the Reapers of the Grimm: Two of the bad-news dudes come over from Germany, after Sal -- who knows Nick isn't just a Portland homicide cop, but is a Grimm -- decides to send for extra muscle to take Nick out. The climax, at the dam where the Eisenbiber Lodge is, shows Nick has been practicing with his old-timey Grimm weapons. He fights off the scythe-wielding bad guys, and one of them accidentally cuts off the head of the other. Monroe arrives (after getting a phone call from Nick with the uh-oh instructions, "Bring a shovel"). They decide to send the Reapers in Germany a message. Monroe says when you need to send a message, "two heads are better than one," and whacks the scythe down on the other dead reaper. Back in Germany, the Reaper ... dispatcher? receives a box, opens it and finds both of the dead reapers' heads inside. I guess that is a more forceful message than a strongly worded email.
And both sides denied any desire to bolster or avenge the outcome of the Civil War. Long-ago North-South rivalries never crossed his mind, Bubp insisted. He's a big fan of Reagan and celebrates his legacy, he said, just not at the expense of one of Ohio's most famous sons.
"Even if you don't end up using it, it shows you what you want to say and you get in touch with what you want to say and who you are as an artist," she said.
This won't be a cheap date. The entire menu at Red, salads and all, is a la carte. That's often the case at top-shelf steakhouses. That means your indulgence in, say, a starch and a side -- such as the luxuriously rich potatoes au gratin and a crunchy bowlful of green beans combined with tiny pine nuts and chunks of pancetta -- together add $15 to your tab. Fortunately, those sides are designed for sharing, though one can imagine a spirited quarrel over that last spoonful of extra-creamy spuds.

"In over a quarter century with the organization, Flanny became an integral part of the Orioles family, for his accomplishments both on and off the field," Angelos said.

Not that Kasdan hopes to make a habit of this. He's still making big studio-picture plans, collaborating with best-selling thriller writer Harlan Coben on a film based on Coben's "Stay Close." He doesn't expect to have to do that on the cheap, "but it's nice to know, after making 'Darling Companion,' that I could. Nice to keep learning over 60."

øWhen you "match three," you also open spots on the board, since things morph. For example, three clumps of grass turn into one bush and two open spaces, and net you 25 points. The progression varies depending on the objects; but grasses combine to create bushes, bushes combine to create trees, trees combine to create huts and so on until the board is filled with manor houses, cathedrals, castles and more.
His era began in 1958, when as a senior at Phoenix North, he broke a state and national high school shot put record with a throw of 69 feet, 3 inches. That distance is still a state record, the longest held record in Arizona track and field history.

“Wearing your hair natural is a huge trend. Whether you select an unstructured twist, updo, pinned long waves or a messy bun depends on your preference and personality. Braids are as big as ever right now, too. You can have different types of textures in one hairstyle and still keep it simple. Last summer was about feathers; this year it will be colored hair extensions. A lot of celebrities use them, and they are great fun and inexpensive. You can maintain them yourself because of a temporary adhesive strip, and they come in a variety of colors. The dress should reflect your personality, and the hairstyle should ALWAYS accent what you are wearing. Take a picture of your dress and any hairstyles you like to your stylist on prom day. Don't bring a crowd with you; it may influence your decision and you could regret it. Have a great time!"

For example, at the screening I attended, Mancow Muller was there with his twin daughters, Ava Grace and Isabella Sofia, who are sweethearts. No doubt he was grateful for the public service announcement at the end of the movie by the Farrellys, who demonstrated to the audiences that the hammers and sledgehammers the Stooges hit each other on the head with were rubber props. They also used slow motion to show that no Stooge is REALLY being poked in the eye, but at the eyebrows.

We probably have a couple thousand species over these three acres, and I oversee the entire collection. If I hear about a new plant - one that's newly discovered or brought into cultivation for the first time - that I think has potential for us, I'll try and track it down. There's a lot of experimentation involved when bringing new plants to the garden, and the key question is whether or not they'll succeed in our climate. There's a lot of trial and error in finding what works. I'm also in charge of hybridizing plants. I look for two plants that have complementary characteristics and combine them to make something new and possibly better in some way than the original two plants.
Past and present Chicago Bears, including Otis Wilson, Richard Dent and Israel Idonije, acted as celebrity bartenders, mixing up cocktails and chatting with excited fans.

* Through his first three starts, opponents are batting .080 against Kyle Lohse's fastball, and .091 against his slider. Lohse has used the fastball on 55 percent of his pitches.

His in-zone rate for the fastball and changeup is 64 percent, and it's 61 percent for his slider.

But just because you personally aren't interested doesn't mean the local story isn't worth covering. This morning's weather was unusual and dangerous. There were hundreds of accidents caused by slick roads. Did this warrant coverage until 10 a.m.? Maybe not -- but if you were trying to get out, you'd have thought so. And you might have thought it was more important than yet another political story or celebrity interview on one of the morning national "news" shows. (By the way, did you check "Good Morning America"? It often airs when the others are preempted.)

Kind of a slow week for wide releases at the theaters this week, except for the whole "Twilight" thing, of course. The first half of the vampire saga's final chapter hits screens this week, along with the adorable penguin of "Happy Feet Two," that being the only major release going up against the "Twilight" money-machine. Plus, "Inkubus," "The Women on the 6th Floor" and "Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone" are in limited release.
The prevailing view in the markets is that the arrest of Strauss-Kahn in New York on charges he sexually assaulted a maid in his hotel room, is unlikely to derail a euro78 billion bailout of Portugal or alter discussions about whether Greece will need any more aid, on top of last year's euro110 billion financial rescue.

Also I heard some of the Stones stuff. There was talk of reissuing "Exile on Main St.," and I had just gotten a new copy of "Sticky Fingers." And I was like, "You know what?

To do for forests what "Cadillac Desert" did for water, Rutkow needs to get out of the New York Public Library Allen Room and tour Appalachia in the era of mountain top removal. He needs to see what climate change and fire are doing to the vanishing pinyon forests of New Mexico, update his knowledge about logging in the Cascades.

Protect your fruit trees from sunscald. It is not uncommon for midwinter's grip to ease long enough to allow sap to rise. When temperatures drop again to freezing, the tree cambium dies on the exposed west side, halting the passage of water and nutrients where the cambium has been damaged. Cover the first couple of feet of your fruit trees' trunks with a tree wrap or white exterior latex paint with a bubble wrap cover, or use pipe insulation to keep the cold at bay.

In recent years when Dick Clark would appear on his "Rockin' New Years Eve" on ABC-TV to count down to midnight with his protege Ryan Seacrest, there were some who felt Mr. Clark shouldn't be on television any more, even for a brief moment. Slowed by a stroke he had suffered in 2004, Clark had great difficulty speaking and was sometimes almost unintelligible. "America's Oldest Living Teenager" was now a frail old man, and some viewers felt uncomfortable with the juxtaposition of Mr. Clark's appearance and the giddy, youthful, here's-to-the-future vibe of Times Square on New Year's Eve.

What is rare is for members to acknowledge such transgressions. The outrage over the infamous 2005 attempt by Sen. Carole Migden to cast a vote for one of her bills when it was in the Assembly was an aberration. When the violation is among members in the same house, within the same party, the pressure to close ranks is intense. At least one other Assembly Democrat privately told colleagues that he was the victim of a ghost vote against his will in the last week of May. He declined to be interviewed.

What stuck out the most was the play of quarterback Keith Price. He won't be 100 percent for the Alamo Bowl --- it's best to realize now that likely won't happen until he has some rest and real time to heal after the season (and maybe a little procedure along the way). But he looked great throwing the ball and running around a little better than he has most of the season.

What can we do about it? Differences in genetic makeup, metabolism and even bacteria levels in the gut explain why some people gain weight and others don't. But obesity experts are quick to add that just because you've inherited a tendency to put on pounds doesn't mean you have to feed that tendency. Everyone can build lean-muscle mass through exercise, especially weight training, to boost metabolism. That will help you burn more calories even at rest. Exercise also may give brown fat a boost. Pregnant moms need to be especially mindful of excess weight gain, sugar consumption and controlling blood-sugar levels through diet and exercise so they don't pass on problems to future generations. Losing baby weight between pregnancies also would help. While Americans do their part, scientists will continue to look at ways to manipulate gut bacteria and hormone levels to help prevent weight gain — and weight regain.

From taxi ways to terminals, it's all squeezed into one of the smallest footprints of any major U.S. airport: 3,425 acres compared to Dallas-Ft. Worth's 18,076. There is nowhere else to go but up.
Although it's easy to dwell on sensationalist and unproven accusations, the facts are that Rural/Metro was and continues to be an exceptionally strong partner with the City and proudly serves the residents of the City as it has for the last 14 years.

When they offered me, it was pretty exciting and I verbally committed.”
“Working for the city was a good thing. When you like what you’re doing, it’s never, ‘Oh, man, I got to get up and go to work tomorrow,’” he said.
The worst part of Game 3 was also a Red Wings goal. Late in the second period, Johan Franzen, after a mad Detroit skirmish near the Nashville net, took a loose puck and fired it in. The red light lit. But so did the blue light. And when the smoke cleared, blue beat red by about a tenth of a second. A goal that would have tied the game was ruled never a goal at all.
‘‘It just seemed like it was a year where maybe a little bit more frustration set in than it should have,'' said Crawford, who had an .893 save percentage in the playoffs. ‘‘Overall, I look at it and it wasn't as bad a year as most people would think. There was definitely a lot of good hockey, but I've just got to make sure that those down times aren't as long or aren't as bad for next season.''

The 2.0-liter base engine is new. It replaces a normally aspirated 3.0-liter straight-six that used more fuel and produced less power. The new 328i is slightly heavier than the 2011 model.
The strange case of defensive lineman Lt. Ben Garland, the Air Force Academy graduate who was impressive in Broncos camp two years ago, also is in place. He had to report in 2010 to active duty and was placed on military/reserve. Later, Garland decided not to become a pilot, was given a press relations position and will finish his active duty this year. He could be a rookie again.

Heckert's had two drafts. And now this is his second free agent shopping season. So we'll split the difference and call it Year 1A. The GM has a great situation.

In Ben Rosenthal's "Ten High," set in a bar, two gangsters -- their dialogue a cross between Damon Runyon and David Mamet -- discuss an outlandish murder plot. Sitting nearby, a long-married couple bickers over an alleged affair. The resolution hinges on a lethal poison that threatens to intertwine their fates.
When social security first began, there were seniors that could not fathom the concept of the government sending them money and did not cash the checks, or those first years of checks, my grandfather among them.

When we attended the annual Feast of Lanterns Festival in Pacific Grove, I did not imagine that 65 years ago squid boats lit at night were used to attract the mollusks, a harvest no one desired until the Chinese created a market for them. After 1906, the year someone set fire to the Point Alones Chinatown, where the Monterey Bay Aquarium now stands, Pacific Grove residents grew nostalgic for the lights, like fairy lanterns on the water, and so a magic tale was born to glimmer.

"I'm pretty upset already about the money and now I'm upset that some weirdo is following us. I'm pulling bundles of money out and I'm counting. I was putting it piles of thousands, and then moving it over to a $5,000 stack. It's better to put $5,000 together the best you can. I was mad about the money and I was mad about Adam Heikkila. I'm pretty sure I was cursing him out. I say, 'This is it, this is the last -- I'm (expletive) done with you, this is the last deal we're going to do.'" I looked up and he was pointing the gun and he said, 'Give me the (expletive) money.' I put my hands up; I grabbed the gun, it went off. He reached around the seat for the gun. I just started pulling the trigger -- I just started pulling the trigger."

Haridopolos, the flip side. Here's the good news on our Brevard County legislator: He's one of the few leaders standing tall when it comes to pill mills. While Gov. Rick Scott wants to get rid of a database for heavy users of prescription drugs — something that has broad bipartisan support from politicians and law enforcement — Haridopolos is standing firm. "We have no interest whatsoever of scrapping that database," he said in a recent story by the News Service of Florida. "I strongly believe that we have to get a handle on this." Haridopolos is right. That doctors in Florida prescribe more oxycodone than doctors in the other 49 states combined is appalling. So, good for Haridopolos for having such backbone. Heck, more backbone and fewer book deals, Senator, and this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

He believes the practice of birthright citizenship rests on a misconstruing of the 14th Amendment.

They must think Americans are suffering from amnesia and cannot recall President George W. Bush and his "Top Gun" moment in 2003. Just in case anyone really has forgotten, allow me to recap: Bush tucked himself into a flight suit emblazoned with the words "commander-in-chief," climbed into a Lockheed S-3 Viking fixed-wing aircraft and helped fly and land it on the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the Abraham Lincoln, just off the California coast. There, under a huge banner declaring "Mission Accomplished" (a banner White House officials initially denied, but finally admitted, was their creation), the president said, "In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed."
Citing federal and state patient privacy laws, a BCA StoneCrest spokesman said last month he couldn't comment.
But in fairness, Martz didn't have the weapons needed to run his scheme, starting with major problems on the offensive line that were arguably never resolved. The offensive line certainly lacked continuity until the bye week. Not coincidentally Tice and Martz had a heart-to-heart at that stage and came to an understanding that they couldn't block up the wide-open, pass-happy system that is the coordinator's calling card. So the maverick coordinator reeled in his flamboyant tendencies and ran the most balanced offense in the league in terms of run and pass plays, keying a five-game winning streak as part of a 7-2 close to the season.
"There's always been pressure on me for either signing (with Portland) or signing somewhere else," Danso said. "The coaching staff convinced me to stay (in Portland). I feel like this is the best place for me to be."
Schmitt has reciprocated Orban's support by quickly signing into law all of the hundreds of bills passed over the last 18 months by the two-thirds parliamentary majority of Orban's Fidesz party and its Christian Democrat allies.

The Dardennes' deceptively simple approach to storytelling, their documentary-like sense of place, and the incredible work they get from their actors are things to admire.

It wasn't until 2007, two years into the project, that he began to understand that he was going to need a personal lens. The catalyst was the suicide of his grandfather, Eugene Seelye, who had lived for 80 of his 83 years on the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota (where Treuer was also born and raised). "My grandfather's death was tragic," he says, "but his life was not tragic. I didn't want him to be defined in terms of his last fraction of a second when there was so much more." As an example, Treuer notes that Seelye lived in the only place that mattered to him, surrounded by the only people who mattered to him, a bounty that eludes many more overtly privileged lives.

Harman quickly intervened and wound up establishing a groundbreaking program aimed at improving conditions for employees. Workers could earn idle time by producing their quotas faster and go home earlier.

The frustrating part for the current edition is that it has performed better than its record. I'm not going to say the Browns should have beaten the Buccaneers or Romeo Crennel's Chiefs or the Ravens -- but they could have won any one of those games.

Instead, House Republicans have voted repeatedly on budgets that will never be followed and similarly doomed attempts at repealing Obama priorities.

The reason may be that prolonged unconsciousness can blot out the memory of the traumatic event.
Critics complain the new constitution erases checks and balances on state power — and Fidesz controls virtually all state power by virtue of its two-thirds majority in parliament.

There were standard repertoire albums this year, but the best of the releases tended to be a little more unusual.

With his relentless emphasis on pacing, Fiennes’ film loses something of the classic’s depth and power; events that should unfold gradually seem to spring to life within moments.

None of the roughly two-dozen reader submissions sent to letters@latimes.com (two of which were published on Monday's page) even attempted to note a remotely apologetic aspect of AT&T's grip on California lawmakers. Some readers pointed to the story as Exhibit A in the case for campaign finance reform; others were incredulous over legislators' attempts to deny that AT&T's lavish gift-giving in Sacramento had much influence at all over laws and regulations.
As a result, our clients have been extremely helpful in working with us and moving business away from the more expensive participant in this network. And at the end of last year, we said we were confident that 95% of our script volume was going to continue into 2012 without Walgreens. We're a week now into the year. Obviously, a week doesn't make a year, but certainly, the trends we're seeing in the first week validate that, that we indeed are seeing that the scripts move away and we are more confident now that 95% of the script volume will continue without Walgreens.
We have also had to adapt to working with less staff and fewer resources. Yet politicians would point the finger of blame at us and our unions with one hand while handing out tax breaks to big businesses with the other. We refuse to be the governor's scapegoats and allow him to take the focus away from what really matters to the people of Ohio: creating jobs, allowing us to make a livable wage to take care of our families, and being treated with dignity and respect.
With Albert Pujols gone, Freese hits fifth, an ideal RBI spot behind Holliday and Lance Berkman. Freese's ability to hit to the opposite field should prevent long slumps and help the Cardinals' lineup score more than anyone thinks possible.
Highlight of the day: Newark to LBI with one mile spent on the Parkway. You try it.
The King of Beers is now sort of the Duke of Beers, its U.S. sales ranking behind Bud Light and Coors Light. This is hard to understand except as evidence of the abject failure of American public education.

Here's another story making the rounds: The full-body scanners will give you cancer.

Sorry, got distracted there. Tenley's helicopter lands. Chris Harrison escorts her like a lamb to the slaughter. She's lovely in a strapless golden gown. She feels positive her new life with Jake begins today. She and Jake stand face to face on a flower-bedecked veranda overlooking the water. Jake tells her how perfect she is, then gets teary when dropping the bomb. "I don't know what it is," he says. "Something doesn't feel right." Classy to the end, Tenley is tearful and upset but says, "I don't know what you think is missing, but thank you for showing me what I could have." Sob! "I was able to give my heart to you and I'm not sad that I did." Sob! Sniff! "But thank you for making me feel special."

The red-meat parade of successes continued with a frequent special, rack of lamb Dijon ($32 for 4-bone), which highlighted the kitchen's emphasis on successful simplicity.

You sit on bleachers in front of a big tank, and the mermaids put on a play underwater. It's impressive. They lip-sync songs, swim and smile like underwear models, all while pretending they aren't drowning. Back in the '50s and '60s, being a Weeki Wachee mermaid was the glamour job to have if you were airline-stewardess pretty and weren't afraid of the bends. These days the mermaids all look like Tampa Bay Bucs cheerleaders.

Teachers say the district doesn't do enough to protect them, or students, when students are disruptive or violent in the classroom.
Detroit has just two quarterbacks on the roster, starter Matthew Stafford and Shaun Hill.
If the real question is how often schools suspend students — which obviously affects black students more than other groups — the answer is simple: far too often. Ordinarily, the public thinks of zero tolerance as invoking consequences for drugs or weapons. But in recent years, it has been applied in alarming numbers to much less serious violations — especially disruptive behavior. The idea is that by removing the troublemaker for a day or more, the school becomes a calmer place where others can achieve.
I'm from Mayfield. My wife's from Boston: Koyen Parikh Shah. We met at Yale. There began my campaign to bring her to Cleveland. She was the first Global Clevelander from my perspective. We ended up in Malaysia first, then Cleveland.
Sometimes, however, the tongue changes. Three disorders -- with no serious health consequences but lots of ick factor -- include black-hairy, yellow and geographic tongue.

It's nice enough, but it could use some updating to reflect the personality of the bistro and the quaint village atmosphere.
There's another way to look at the future, however, and it's one that plays to St. Louis' strengths. Maybe the next 40 years won't belong to the places that seem cool today. Maybe, instead, they will favor cities that are affordable, livable and business-friendly.
"There may be a lot of voters who have voted by mail. They may be waiting for their applications," Frost said Friday. "We need to tell them what to do to get their applications."

Fulham winger Bryan Ruiz will miss the rest of the season after breaking his foot.
Sarah McLachlan: with Symphony Orchestra, 7:30 p.m. July 1. $25-$49.50.
There are obvious reasons to criticize the Dolans and the Indians: drafting, talent evaluation, drafting, player development in some cases and -- most of all -- drafting. Beating the owners-are-too-cheap drum is an oversimplification in a sport without a salary cap and in a city struggling in a tough economy.
If any meeting occurred, it didn't appear to do much good. In the summer of 2008, the Argentine government declared that Cargill and 56 other firms together retroactively owed $1.7 billion in grain export taxes, according to a cable.

The filmmakers - including Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn - are aware of the power they wield, and so make sure the movie not only meets expectations but also is accessible to everyone. They succeed with flying colors, injecting our real world with Marvel-style myth. They even make sure to frame the cast in several valiant, poster-ready tableaux.

If they are convicted, Gartland faces up to 12 years in prison for the federal-election related charges unsealed today and O'Leary faces up to 11 years in prison.
For Alvarado, it's also about not being able to let go of old clothes she loves. Sort of like the penultimate scene in "Pretty in Pink," when Molly Ringwald sews old prom dresses into her own creation, refashioning is a favorite pastime of Alvarado's.
"That's the great unknown. What might develop down the road is a market for privately traded securities," Shirodkar says. If so, he adds, investors don't have to buy just publicly traded stock.

Up front: The Hawks are simply deeper and more talented. There isn't much there for the Coyotes behind the ageless Ray Whitney, Radim Vrbata and Shane Doan, but they can make the Hawks pay for their errors. Vrbata (35 goals) has a tendency to score big and frustrating goals against his former team.
ELIZABETH — Joyce Vence holds the oval image, hanging from one of the many necklaces she wears, between her thumb and index finger. It’s her smiling, white-haired mother — an 89-year-old woman who was killed five years ago.
The school secured its salad bar with a grant through Let's Move: Salad Bars to Schools, which partners with the Whole Foods supermarket chain. And, she said, students are starting to take their health more seriously, she said.

"Then the guys on defense -- Eddie Pleasant has done a really good job in the secondary, along with John Boyett. At linebacker you've got Dewitt Stuckey and Michael Clay, and on the D-Line almost all of them are leaders. I think Terrell Turner is kind of the vocal one, but the way they all practice ... they've all been through it."
During practice Monday, Williams said the coaches installed "quite a few'' new sets aimed specifically to get him open. Plus Williams plans to take a different mindset into Game 2 on Tuesday night with Derrick Rose out.

Attorney Noah Kushlafsky of Kreindler and Kreindler, who represents 200 victims, thinks the offer is a good deal. He told PIX 11 News, "If your illness is one of those listed, you have to prove nothing else than the fact that you were there. But in court, you have to prove your illness is a result of being there." People exposed to World Trade Center dust and smoke have blamed it for hundreds of illnesses. But, currently the fund only covers a limited number of ailments, including asthma, scarred lungs and other respiratory system problems.

Cancerous cells produce a boatload of EphA2, way more than normal cells do. While that would seem to restrict the cancer cells' movement, paradoxically, the opposite is true. EphA2 morphs into a bad cop that helps cancerous cells spread and form additional tumors. This two-faced conduct has been a major mystery to cancer researchers, who have wondered how the molecule can function as both a tumor promoter and suppressor.

Expected or not, the old and new math calculating high school graduates is jarring. Given that the topic involves education, it’s easy and natural for any former student to equate the graduation rate with a classroom grade. It’s an unfair analogy, to be sure, but psychologically an 81 percent, a “B,” is a lot easier to collectively stomach than the “D” represented by a 67.4.

Instead, it seemed as though the team would be in position for another top lottery pick to aid in the rebuilding process.
So whom does that leave? Well, there is … Mitt Romney. On Thursday he was clever and classy, characterizing the Iowa outcome as "a virtual tie" and taking time to "once again recognize Rick Santorum for his strong performance in the state."
Long appears to have everything he needs to fire him, but the question is whether he will actually get rid of Petrino, who failed to mention having Dorrell, 25, with him during the accident and then admitted the two had an inappropriate relationship.

"His arm speed is unbelievable," Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair said of Wada's change-up. "He's got great arm action and can throw it for strikes, throw it for a chase. He knew what he was doing.

Shayna was in her first year at Gilbert High, after attending two small charter schools. "She wanted the whole high-school experience," her mother said, but "she did not adjust well'' to the large school. "She was a small-town girl.''
Colt McCoy is destined to be a better "real" quarterback than fantasy quarterback. He has all the intangibles you want in a team leader, but lacks the arm strength to air it out with the big guns. Add in his underwhelming wide receiver corps and the degree of difficulty in playing outdoors in the winter, and McCoy will be a bye-week substitute at best.
Don't judge a book by its cover -- and don't judge a show by its title. The name of Stephen Belber's new two-hander, "Dusk Rings a Bell," evokes the horrifying prospect of an Emily Dickinson poetry slam. But the play's not that bad.
Feingold shot and killed an intruder trying to rob the store a couple of years ago, Ayala said. Even though it was done in self-defense, Feingold always felt remorseful, Ayala said.

SMALL BUT BOLD: Enid Woodward proves small doesn't mean boring. Her 600-square-foot apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side not only can be toured while standing still, but its comic-book colors will make you rethink the idea of boldness in a small space.
It is illegal to use state campaign funds, regulated under Ohio law, for a federal campaign, regulated under federal law. Simply put, if you want to run for Ohio dog catcher (a fictional post), you must follow Ohio law, and if you then decide to run for Congress -- or even just want to consider such a run -- you must file paperwork with the FEC, start a federal account and steer clear of mingling the money you raised running for dog catcher. The law keeps candidates from doing an end-run around federal campaign funding restrictions.
"Ever since we had John Ryan as the executive secretary, the organization moved in a new direction, said Meryl Johnson, a Cleveland Teachers Union trustee and federation reporting secretary.

This culture of impoverishment started to change, however, when the down-home charismatic Courtney started coaching, and his unique combination of candor and casual eloquence is a tonic to everyone who hears it.
President Obama is fond of blaming his troubles on an obstructionist Congress, though he had massive majorities in both houses for two years — and the reason the House of Representatives now opposes him is simply because it was ordered to do so by the same voters he believes wanted him to go even further down the path he was heading.

Verizon has wider domestic network coverage than AT&T does, particularly for the older "3G" wireless broadband. In the interior of the country, it covers vast areas that AT&T doesn't. In the big cities of the coasts, iPhone service can be spotty because of crowding on AT&T's network.

øSince not all student loans participate in IBR or loan forgiveness, you could certainly ask your lender about a graduated payment. Graduated payments result in a lower payment for a pre-determined amount of time, but the payments will eventually increase. This could make sense if you felt something will change in your financial situation. Make sure to ask the lender in advance what your payment will be when it increases, because it will be necessary to have the income to meet this payment further down the road.
Provider payments: Reduced payments to doctors, hospitals, health plans and other providers of 10 percent.

"Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk to police," Kennedy said. "Had he made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would have invoked his 'right to cut off questioning.' Here he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to remain silent."
The high-scoring series has featured plenty of nasty hits and fisticuffs, but Game 4 wasn't nearly as physical. Nobody dropped the gloves, but there were several penalties and a few misconducts.

And I took my grandson to the Aztecs basketball game Saturday night for his birthday.
* Here are some strong words from retired five-time Gold Glove center fielder Andy Van Slyke, who believes Colby Rasmus needs to be more aggressive in going back on balls in center field. Van Slyke spoke Monday on my 101 ESPN radio show.

After last year’s disappointing defeat in the semifinals, Diaby pledged he would get MLK back to the top of the PSAL mountain and did so, scoring 17 times and adding 10 assists despite missing seven games with an abdominal strain.

LAS VEGAS — For all of the studs UNLV coach Dave Rice currently has on the roster, and all of the ones he'll recruit in the future, his best recruiting job may always be prying Stacey Augmon away from the Nuggets and getting him back to Las Vegas.
The Buzzcocks' own story has been similarly unpredictable. Who would have suspected, back when Diggle's band was opening for the Sex Pistols in 1976, that we'd still be talking about the Buzzcocks as an active and vital force in the music industry in 2012? Indeed, one could make a convincing case that the Buzzcocks are currently the world's greatest punk-rock band.
Noting that Obama recently cited the inventive genius of Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers, he even joked that the president’s administration would have hamstrung them. “A regulator would have shut down the Wright brothers for their ‘dust pollution,’” he said. “And the government would have banned Thomas Edison’s light bulb. Oh yeah, they just did.”
But it wouldn’t have been right to refuse his own wedding cake that day 25 years ago. And the couple’s honeymoon to St. Thomas included unlimited meals.
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a case about brutality and cruelty,'' Hestrin told the jury in his opening statement.
A: One is that I'm going to start advocating for teachers and their need for professional development as we move forward with the Common Core. That's really going to be a game-changer for our teachers. We need to look at our teachers as we do with our students. We're going to have some of our teachers ready to jump right on and others that are going to need intervention. We need to understand that this is a large change for them.... If we have the concept of "no child left behind," we need to take on the mentality of "no teacher left behind."

Yee has written a bill, SB 1363 — co-sponsored by the Ella Baker Center and the Youth Justice Coalition — to regulate solitary confinement of juvenile offenders. It wouldn't ban the practice but would, sensibly, require that solitary last only as long as it must to prevent substantial risk of harm or substantial risk to security, and be used only after less restrictive measures have been tried.
"I think it's mainly just attitude," May said. "A little bit of a lack of leadership on the team. That's been killing us. It's been hurting us in practice and in the matches. We have a lot of potential, but not the leadership we need."

A few days ago, they broke ground on a new palace for the San Francisco 49ers. The good folks in Los Angeles are just clamoring to plop down $800 million or so if the NFL will give them another chance.

Westfeldt's screenplay reaches for the rat-a-tat-tat of screwball. Occasionally she achieves it, thanks to a gifted cast that includes Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd and the filmmaker's real-life partner, Jon Hamm. But the interactions can also feel forced. Infant diarrhea and fraught nerves notwithstanding, these are seamless lives, where babies are rite-of-passage accessories.

We would not waste our time exploring the depths of Mr. Limbaugh's misogyny or the likelihood of any genuine "heartfelt" remorse on his part, but we would note that he remains the poster child of public incivility, and the likelihood of further such incidents is high. The fact that advertisers are dropping his show, and some stations have decided no longer to carry it, is no surprise. Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates for office who wish to promote conservative views without them being associated with such personal attacks would be wise to offer a more robust denunciation of the talk show host than they have so far produced.

Orchestras in North Korea play in grand, impressive halls, Chung said. But the Unhasu's repertoire is somewhat limited. "They play light classical music, the kind you might expect from the Boston Pops," he said. "But not so much mainstream symphonic repertoire — that is a skill that has to be developed." They also play folk music and national hymns using traditional Korean instruments.

CLEVELAND, Ohio — No sporting event, no street festival, not even a sunset over the lake can make you feel as tight of a connection with Cleveland as running the marathon or half-marathon.

A: You know, that is something that has been perpetuated that is in fact completely false. I thought you might say that, so here's a quote from a letter from the counsel general of Canada dated February 2011. He writes that "the government of Canada has no interest in disadvantaging the Ambassador Bridge's long-term sustainability." And has repeatedly said Canada would not block twinning (the existing bridge) if that option were to receive the environmental and other approvals like the Detroit River International Crossing requires.

We live close to Shaker Square and visit the farmers market there most Saturdays. We can walk there on a nice day and then have breakfast at Yours Truly.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived early at the Brussels summit and held a series of one-on-one meetings with other euro-zone leaders, urging them to back his plan: With the crisis widening beyond Greece, the leaders should announce a massive rescue fund that same day, big enough to save any euro-zone nation from default.

But this is Charles Mee's gonzo retelling of the classic Greek myth about one of the world's first dysfunctional families, so anything goes. (Actors also speechify through megaphones, dirty-dance under strobe lights, wrestle in slow motion and lip-sync to the Backstreet Boys in this intentionally fractured, sensory overload of a production, renamed "Iphigenia 2.0.")
Such harmony between the siblings is rare in rock music circles. White Mystery has none of the storied conflict of the Beach Boys, Oasis or the Everly Brothers.

Media organizations, including Tribune Co. (which owns the Los Angeles Times) and a coalition of newspapers, including the Miami Herald, and local television stations, have filed motions to make all documents public.

Not surprisingly, the movie attracted a 58% male crowd — the gender Fox has been heavily courting for weeks in advertisements on sports networks such as ESPN. Chris Aronson, Fox's executive vice president of distribution, said the studio consciously targeted men because "dumb, slapstick humor is male-driven stateside, and we've always known there was a barrier with females."

It speaks to the volatility of those two franchises in particular -- no surprise that they are managed by the combustible Bobby Valentine and Ozzie Guillen, respectively. However, it also speaks to a general unpredictability that is part of the majors in 2012.
Now, we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We’re selling acres of federal office space that hasn’t been used in years, and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote – and we will push to get it passed.

You don't reserve tables at Next, you purchase tickets, much as you would for a concert. Diners pay in advance for a seating at a particular time. What they are served varies, as the notoriously modernist Achatz changes the menu every three months. Last year, the best new restaurant honor went to Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC Kitchen in New York.
This Roscoe Village organic bakery bills itself as offering "punk rock pastry." And if that means many of the goodies are surprisingly inventive, I would have to agree. Sure, you'll find the standards: brownies, cookies, whoopie pies and cheesecake bars, all generously sized, by the way. And there's a gorgeous, postcard-perfect vista of cupcakes on display — about a dozen flavors available each month, four to six of them vegan. However, foodies will appreciate the assortment of thoughtful creations such as chocolate chip cookies with bacon (yes, the bacon is organic), blueberry pie with lavender streusel, basil and goat cheese croissants, tequila-lime cupcakes and ginger-cream scones. And speaking of scones, the vegan Take a Hike scones, made with whole-wheat flour, oats, seeds and dried fruit, are the bakery's best-seller. Most items are sweetened with evaporated cane juice. Extra bonus: With its tattoo-art touches and neon-hued walls and tables, the shop has a punk rock feel too.
"It is like they are so focused on undermining President Obama that it's almost as if they're rooting for America to fail," he said. "The truth is, America is a world leader on energy production."

In fact, the entire concept of brunch with scrambled eggs and pancakes and maple syrup is a bit foreign to Schwertner. As a kid, brunch was a savory affair. On Sundays after church, she'd come home to hot soup with marrow bones, or cabbage stuffed with pork.

How to see them: From Hanalei Town, if you stay on Kuhio Highway, the next beach will be Lumahai Beach (a five-minute walk from the road). (Lumahai is unmarked, but you'll see cars parked along the highway). To get to Blackpot Beach, Hanalei Bay and the pier, you turn right on Aku Road off Kuhio Highway, then go one block and turn right on Weke Road (which parallels Hanalei Bay). The road dead-ends into the parking lot for Blackpot Beach and Hanalei Pier.

Trayvon was "profiled" by Zimmerman, who "falsely assumed (Trayvon) was going to commit a crime" as the teen was trying to get back to the home of his father's girlfriend, according to public filings by Florida special prosecutor Angela Corey.

5. Car 54, Where Are You? (1994): Not that the old TV show with Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis and Joe E. Ross was a monument to quality, but the film with David Johansen and John C. McGinley brought actual physical pain. And guess who plays one of the female leads? Our dear Rosie O.
Many questions remain, but early reaction from the neighborhood has been one part jubilation, one part wonder: "I can't believe they actually listened to us," says Swansea Elementary principal Gilberto Munoz.
"It certainly was one of the goals to win the World Dressage Masters," said the rider, whose to-do list also included medaling at the 2010 World Equestrian Games (he got two bronze medals) and winning at Aachen, Germany, practically a sacred site for dressage (he took the top prizes there in 2009).

Where he gets his ideas: The best ideas are ones that come out of the clear blue, though he looks for flavor combinations that will dovetail with the dishes coming out of the kitchen.
Is the trade-off worth it? That's a potent question for YA sci-fi readers to ponder, but something about this stage adaptation from Eric Coble flattens out what is a slight book to begin with. Once you give a story like this physical dimensions, it becomes clear just how limited and underdeveloped Lowry's story actually is. It's always tricky when adult actors play children, straddling that line between youthful verisimilitude and exaggerated pandering, and too often Brian Bell's production for Adventure Stage Chicago falls into the latter category. More troublingly, the play chickens out just when the narrative stakes need to become disturbing. What's the point of staging this kind of story, if you're not willing to deeply engage with its darker implications?
Bill Hannegan, a leading critic of smoking bans, acknowledged Lindsey's tenacity. But he said her group overreaches in seeking to strengthen a ban that he said already goes too far.
Throughout the trial and during his sentencing yesterday, Howard maintained his innocence.
The actions are part of a larger effort by the White House to draw contrasts with congressional Republicans who have opposed Obama's jobs legislation a year before the 2012 election.

Meanwhile, remember that the average American uses double the energy of the average European! Why?

-- The Kings and Blues are similar in system and approach; it's just that the Kings are playing a superior version of that style of hockey. And the Kings are further along on the progression curve because of their overall experience level and more extensive mileage in postseason hockey. (Again, this is the Kings' third consecutive excursion in the postseason, and that tends to season a team and give the players a true understanding of what it takes to go far at this time of year.
